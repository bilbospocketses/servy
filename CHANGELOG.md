# Servy fork — Changelog

> Hard fork of [aelassas/servy](https://github.com/aelassas/servy). This top section records **fork-specific** changes. Upstream Servy's full release history is preserved below under [Changelog (upstream)](#changelog-upstream). Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased] — fork

### Added
- `VISION.md` — architecture-of-record for the cross-platform / multi-arch / Velopack-integration direction.

### Changed
- Fork-forward rewrite of `README.md`, `NOTES.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` to establish the fork's identity and vision; `setup/*/README.md` de-branded as fork local-test notes.
- Repository hardening / lockdown — branch + tag rulesets, SHA-pinned GitHub Actions.
- Branch model for at-will upstream sync: `vnext` is the locked default branch (all fork work + the protection ruleset); the upstream mirror (first created as `main`, **renamed to `upstream-main`**) is a pristine, unprotected mirror of `upstream/main`, synced on demand via `git fetch upstream && git push origin upstream/main:upstream-main`. The fork's `build`/`test`/`security`/`loc` workflows run on `vnext`; the upstream `sonar` (SonarCloud) workflow does not run in the fork. Renaming the mirror off `main` stops it from re-running (and failing) upstream's `main`-triggered CI on every sync.
- CI resilience: the `test` workflow now retries flaky upstream integration tests (ProcessKiller file-lock termination, ProcessLauncher output multiplexing) up to 3× so transient runner-timing failures self-heal, and the ARM64 leg is now advisory (`continue-on-error`) since the fork does not ship ARM64 yet — only `Test (x64)` gates `vnext`. README build/test badges retargeted to `?branch=vnext`.
- CI: CodeQL (the `Static Analysis (CodeQL)` job in the `security` workflow) now runs on push-to-`vnext` + the weekly schedule only — **not on `pull_request`**. PR-time CodeQL gated each merge on GitHub's code-scanning backend finishing SARIF processing; on a large upstream-absorb PR that processing stalled ~30 min, leaving the `github-advanced-security` `CodeQL` check queued indefinitely and blocking auto-merge even though it is not a required status check. The post-merge push to `vnext` stays the authoritative scan (squash-merge fork); Dependency + Secret scanning still run on PRs.

### Notes
- The fork tracks upstream `main` (last synced to `ef6b78644`, 2026-06-09, post-8.4) and is otherwise **code-identical to upstream** — only documentation and CI triggers diverge, no product behavior. Released, signed Windows binaries come from upstream.

* fix(core): Helper.EscapeArgs and ProcessHelper.EscapeProcessArgument implement the same Win32 algorithm in two different files (#872)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.ResolvePath - XML doc and inline comment claim 'SERVICE’s environment' but the call expands the CALLER's environment (#878)
* fix(core): ServiceMapper.ToDomain - RecoveryAction default hardcoded as 'RecoveryAction.RestartService' instead of using 'AppConfig.DefaultRecoveryAction' (#892)
* fix(core): Service.cs (Domain) - RecoveryAction property has no default initializer; falls back to enum 0 (None) instead of AppConfig.DefaultRecoveryAction (RestartService) (#893)

* fix(core): ServiceManager.InstallServiceAsync - gMSA detection via EndsWith("$") misclassifies regular accounts whose name happens to end in $ (#966)
* fix(core): EventLogService.SearchAsync - sourceName constructor parameter is silently overridden by hardcoded AppConfig.EventSource filter at result-time (#969)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.CreateScoped - every scoped logger allocates a fresh EventLog handle (resource leak across scopes) (#973)

* fix(core): HandleHelper.GetProcessesUsingFile - synchronous StandardOutput.ReadToEnd defeats HandleExeTimeoutMs (handle.exe hang would block forever) (#996)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.TerminateBlockingProcesses - extension and targetFileName parameters are unused (kept for 'signature compatibility') (#999)
* fix(core): ServiceExporter.ExportJson and JsonServiceSerializer.Serialize use different JsonSerializerSettings - asymmetric JSON output (#1000)
* fix(core): SecureData.Dispose - _disposed flag set after ZeroMemory; concurrent Dispose calls can race through the guard (#1004)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.GetProcessTreeMetrics - comment claims sum can exceed 100% but the per-process formula is normalized to whole-machine capacity (#1005)
* fix(core): NativeMethods.AtomicSecureMove - name promises atomicity but MoveFileEx falls back to copy+delete across volumes (#1014)
* fix(core): NativeMethods.GetFileIdentity - two empty catch blocks with stale 'Fallback or log failure here if necessary' TODO comments (#1015)
* fix(core): NativeMethods.ValidateCredentials - silently passes for non-gMSA accounts when password is null/empty (function name promises validation) (#1016)
* fix(core): EnvironmentVariableParser.Parse - surrounding quotes are unconditionally stripped, no way to set an env var whose literal value starts and ends with double quotes (#1074)
* fix(core): AppConfig - TFM 'net10.0-windows' hardcoded into three path constants (silently stale on TFM upgrade) (#1027)
* fix(core): AppConfig - three near-identical Get*ServicePath / GetHandleExePath methods (DRY) (#1028)
* fix(core): EventIds.ScriptInfo (1100) and EventIds.ScriptWarning (2100) constants are defined but never referenced anywhere in the codebase (#1039)

* fix(core): RotatingStreamWriter - Thread.Sleep called while holding _lock blocks all writers for up to 100ms during rotation retries (#1066)
* fix(core): RotatingStreamWriter._rotationDisabled is one-way: a single non-IO exception silently disables rotation forever, file grows unbounded (#1067)
* fix(core): RotatingStreamWriter.EnforceMaxRotations regex misses double-collision filenames produced by GenerateUniqueFileName, those rotated logs accumulate forever (#1068)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.GetKey/GetIV - no in-memory caching, full DPAPI roundtrip + 3-retry file read on every call #1069
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider - [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] on entire security class hides DPAPI/ACL regressions from coverage tooling (#1070)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider - three bare catch blocks (lines 256, 274, 310) swallow exceptions without binding the variable (#1071)
* fix(core): SecureData.Decrypt - tampered/truncated v2 payloads silently return the original ciphertext as 'plaintext', callers can't distinguish success from integrity failure (#1072)

* fix(core): ServiceMapper.ToDto omits Pid, ActiveStdoutPath, ActiveStderrPath; Domain->DTO->Domain round-trip silently drops runtime state (#1076)
* fix(core): Logger.Log - exception logged via $"{message}\nException: {ex}" then newline-sanitized to literal \r\n, stack traces become unreadable single-line escaped blobs (#1077)
* fix(core): ServiceValidationRules - service name only checks for '/' and '\', misses other SCM-rejected inputs (leading/trailing whitespace, control chars, '"', '|', etc.) (#1078)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.GetEmbeddedResourceLastWriteTimeUTC name and XML doc claim 'embedded resource' time, actually returns the exe's own File.GetLastWriteTimeUtc (#1079)
* fix(core): LogonAsServiceGrant.cs - [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] on entire LSA-privilege class hides regressions in security-sensitive code (#1092)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.cs - three SCM-tuning consts hardcoded (ServiceStartTimeoutSeconds, ScmPollIntervalMs, MaxParallelScmQueries) and inconsistent 250ms poll in Start/Stop (#1095)
* fix(core): ServiceExporter.cs - private nested Utf8StringWriter duplicates the public Servy.Core.IO.Utf8StringWriter class (#1104)
* fix(core): EscapedTokenizer - three methods duplicate the 'count preceding backslashes' loop (DRY) (#1105)
* fix(core): EnvironmentVariablesValidator.Validate - XML doc says 'exactly one unescaped equals' but code only requires >=1, and CountUnescapedChar pass is redundant before IndexOfUnescapedChar (#1113)
* fix(core): EscapedTokenizer.Unescape - escaped newline/semicolon split asymmetry: split treats \\r and \\n as escaped delimiters but Unescape never strips the backslash, leaving a stray '\' in the value (#1114)
* fix(core): OperationResult.Failure - XML doc claims ArgumentException is thrown only on null, but code throws on whitespace too (#1115)
* fix(core): RotatingStreamWriter.ShouldRotateByDate Weekly mode misses year-on-year rotation when both samples land in 'week 1' under ISO calendar year mismatch (#1116)
* fix(core): Logger.Log error fallback writes to logs/LoggerWriteErrors.log without first ensuring the directory exists, unlike InternalInitialize which calls SecurityHelper.CreateSecureDirectory (#1117)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.SetIsEventLogEnabled - when InitializeEventLog fails, _isEventLogEnabled is overwritten back to the requested 'true' state, leaving _eventLog null but flag pretending logging is on (#1118)
* fix(core): EventLogReader.ReadEvents - cutoff EventRecord at maxReadCount yields break before using-block, leaking the just-fetched native handle (#1119)
* fix(core): ServiceControllerWrapper.BuildDependencyTree - currentPath retains stale entries when an exception is thrown after Add but before RemoveAt, corrupting cycle detection for siblings (#1120)
* fix(core): JsonServiceSerializer.Deserialize logs first 100 chars of malformed JSON to error log on JsonException - can leak Password if it appears early in the payload (#1121)
* fix(core): XmlServiceSerializer.Deserialize/Serialize allocate XmlSerializer per call instead of caching it statically (parallel impl of #1121 + perf hit) (#1122)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.GetAllServices - LogOnAs initialized to magic string "LocalSystem" instead of LocalSystemAccount const defined in same file (#1131)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.UninstallServiceAsync - stop wait loop uses DefaultServiceStopTimeoutSeconds instead of per-service StopTimeout (asymmetric with StopServiceAsync) (#1132)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.GetDependencies - null return is overloaded (means both "service not installed" and "unexpected error") (#1133)
* fix(core): SecurityHelper.CreateSecureDirectory - silently swallows UnauthorizedAccessException without logging, leaves no audit trail when ACL hardening fails (#1137)
* fix(core): XmlServiceValidator/JsonServiceValidator - both treat ValidationResult.Warnings as blocking failures, defeating the purpose of separate Errors/Warnings collections (#1139)
* fix(core): WindowsServiceApi - [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] on the entire class hides regressions in the non-trivial GetServices() loop (parallel to #1070 and #1092) (#1138)
* fix(core): EventIds.cs declares only base ranges (1000/2000/3000) but specific IDs (3001/3002/3003/3103/3104) are hardcoded magic numbers in ProtectedKeyProvider.cs and the taskschd scripts (#1144)
* fix(core): Servy.Core DTOs/ServiceInfo.cs constructor - LogOnAs hardcoded to 'LocalSystem' magic string instead of ServiceAccounts.LocalSystem const (parallel to #1131) (#1160)

* fix(core): EventLogReader.MapToDto - 'evt.TimeCreated ?? DateTime.MinValue' converts implicitly to DateTimeOffset and throws ArgumentOutOfRangeException in non-UTC time zones when TimeCreated is null (#1167)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.cs - [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] on entire class hides regressions in non-trivial logic (BFS process-tree walker, CPU-delta cache pruning, RAM formatter, ResolvePath regex flow); parallel to #1070 / #1092 / #1138 (#1169)
* fix(core): EventLogService.cs - MaxResults (10000) and LogName ('Application') hardcoded as private consts; LogName is also duplicated in EventLogLogger and Helper.EnsureEventSourceExists (#1170)

* fix(core): AppConfig.cs - MaxMaxFailedChecks / MaxMaxRestartAttempts / MaxPreLaunchRetryAttempts set to int.MaxValue, inconsistent with other Max* constants and creates overflow risk in counters (#1193)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.cs - SafeWriteToEventLog reads _eventLog without volatile/lock; SetIsEventLogEnabled can null it concurrently (#1205)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.cs - EventLogMessageMaxChars (31000) hardcoded; should live in AppConfig with the other Event-Log constants (#1206)
* fix(core): Logging-&-Log-Rotation.md - Event ID 3002 is documented in the 'Error' range table but the entry itself describes a Warning, contradicting the actual EventLogEntryType.Warning emitted by the code (#1210)
* fix(core): EnvironmentVariableHelper.cs - ProtectedVariables list omits DOTNET_ROOT, DOTNET_HOST_PATH, DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR - .NET runtime hijacking via env var override (#1212)

* fix(core): JsonServiceValidator.cs - Copy-paste bug: warning log says 'XML Import succeeded with warnings' inside the JSON validator (#1215)
* fix(core): Logger.cs / RotatingStreamWriter.cs - Date format strings use thread-default culture; produce non-Gregorian years on Thai locale (Buddhist calendar) (#1216)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.cs - IDisposable holding decrypted AES key/IV has no finalizer; forgotten Dispose leaves plaintext key material in managed heap until GC (#1220)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.cs - WaitForExit timeout floor only applied to KillParentWaitMs (Math.Max 1000); KillChildWaitMs/KillTreeWaitMs honor smaller values without floor (#1222)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.cs - KillProcessTreeAndParents(int) lacks the top-level try/catch present on the string overload, leaks exceptions to callers (#1223)
* fix(core): EventLogService.cs - EventLogMaxResults caps raw events before filtering; '[' bracket heuristic and provider-name substring filter silently drop matches, so user sees fewer hits than configured (#1228)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.cs - KillParentProcesses recursive call passes DateTime.MinValue, disabling PID-recycling identity check for grandparents and beyond (#1231)
* fix(core): Logger.cs - _currentLogLevel read on hot logging path without volatile or lock; updates may go unobserved (#1236)
* fix(core): ServiceHelper.cs (Core) - StopServices ignores PreStopTimeoutSeconds, stop wait too short when pre-stop hook configured (#1241)

* fix(core): EnvironmentVariableParser.cs - Structural-quote strip eats trailing escaped \\"\, contradicting the documented 'escaped quotes survive' contract (#1296)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.cs - GetProcessTreeMetrics does not cap CPU at 100% despite ProcessMetrics XML doc promising 'capped at 100.0' for trees (#1297)
* fix(core): Logger.cs - _logRotationSizeMB field is long but every public setter takes int; the extra width is dead (#1308)

* fix(desktop,manager,cli,service,restarter): appsettings*.json - DefaultConnection / AESKey / AESIV paths duplicated across 5 files (and re-defined in AppConfig.cs) (#1427)
* fix(manager): ServiceCommands.ExecuteLockedAsync - eager eviction races with GetOrAdd, allows two threads to run the same service operation in parallel (#831)
* fix(manager): LogTailer.RunFromPosition - XML doc references non-existent parameter 'token' (actual name is 'externalToken') (#890)
* fix(manager): ConsoleViewModel.cs - case-sensitive path comparisons trigger spurious resume on Windows (paths are case-insensitive) (#904)
* fix(manager): MainWindow.xaml.cs MainTabControl_SelectionChangedAsync - exception not logged when MessageBoxService is available, silently lost on dialog dismiss (#906)
* fix(manager): App.xaml.cs - typo 'Dependencis' in DependenciesRefreshIntervalInMs XML doc (#910)
* fix(manager): DependenciesViewModel.cs SetExpansion - recursive traversal has no cycle guard, infinite recursion / stack overflow if tree contains a cycle (#912)
* fix(manager): DependenciesViewModel.cs duplicates SearchServicesAsync from ServiceSearchViewModelBase (DRY) (#913)
* fix(manager): ServiceMapper.ToModel - three near-identical overloads (Performance/Console/Dependency Service) instead of one base-class mapping (#919)

* fix(manager): ServiceCommands.CopyPid - Clipboard.SetText called without ensuring STA Dispatcher context (#833)
* fix(manager): ServiceCommands.InstallServiceAsync - 'if (wrapperExeDir == null)' is always true (dead defensive check + CS8600 candidate) (#894)
* fix(manager): DependenciesViewModel.cs - repeated 'depdency treer' typo in three command XML doc-comments (#911)
* fix(manager): Servy.Manager ServiceMapper - '?? string.Empty' is unreachable because GetLogOnAsDisplayName never returns null (#920)
* fix(manager): LogsViewModel.cs - magic number 3 for default 'last N days' filter on first load (#924)
* fix(manager): ServiceRowViewModel.Service_PropertyChanged - explicit switch cases are redundant; default branch already forwards every PropertyName 1:1 (#925)
* fix(manager): LogTailer.LoadHistory - historical lines synthesize timestamps 1ms apart, capping the rendered time-spread of any backlog at maxLines milliseconds (#939)
* fix(manager): ServiceSearchViewModelBase.SearchServicesAsync - Helper.IsRunningInUnitTest() branch in production code path is a layering violation (#983)
* fix(manager): ServiceMapper.GetLogOnAsDisplayName - magic string "LocalSystem" duplicated instead of using a named SCM constant (#984)
* fix(manager): ServiceMapper.GetLogOnAsDisplayName - XML doc typo 'ser session display name' (should be 'User') (#1006)

* fix(manager): MainViewModel - six occurrences of 'if (ServiceCommands == null) throw new InvalidOperationException' (DRY) (#1018)
* fix(manager): MainViewModel - typo 'Setp 5' in step comment (line 583) (#1019)

* fix(manager): PerformanceViewModel.Dispose duplicates the _monitoringCts cleanup already performed by MonitoringViewModelBase.Dispose (#1109)
* fix(manager): CpuUsageConverter & RamUsageConverter - stale 'this will safely return false' comment doesn't match the string-returning code (#1110)
* fix(manager): ServiceConfigurationValidator depends on concrete ServiceValidationRules instead of IServiceValidationRules (parallel to CLI) (#1111)
* fix(manager): ServiceConfigurationValidator.Validate shows first Warning before any Error, hiding the actually-blocking issue (parallel impl of #1108) (#1126)
* fix(manager): PidConverter.Convert - dead null check (early return + redundant '?.' / '??') (#1154)
* fix(manager): Converters - Pid/Message/CpuUsage/RamUsage throw NotImplementedException in ConvertBack while StatusConverter/StartupTypeConverter return Binding.DoNothing (inconsistent) (#1155)
* fix(manager): CpuUsageConverter / RamUsageConverter constructor throws InvalidOperationException at design time when App.Services is null (breaks XAML designer) (#1156)

* fix(manager): Models Service.cs - backing field '_userSession' for LogOnAs property is inconsistent with every other field in the file (#1159)
* fix(manager): LogTailer.cs - Hardcoded MaxSafeLines / LogBatchFlushThreshold / FileRetryDelayMs / 1000ms recovery delay should live in AppConfig (#1203)
* fix(manager): LogTailer.cs - lastPosition tracked via fs.Position overshoots StreamReader buffer; transient errors skip log content on reopen (#1245)
* fix(manager): PerformanceViewModel.cs - 'Pre-allocated to avoid GC pressure' comment is misleading; Clone() still allocates a new PointCollection on every tick (#1264)
* fix(manager): PerformanceViewModel.cs - hardcoded magic '100.0' for stepX should derive from PerformanceHistoryCapacity (#1265)
* fix(manager): LogsViewModel.cs - eventLogService constructor parameter is not null-guarded; sibling deps are (#1267)

* fix(manager): ServiceCommands.cs - CopyPid uses Thread.Sleep on the WPF Dispatcher; clipboard contention freezes the UI for up to 250ms (#1273)
* fix(manager): MainViewModel.cs - Cleanup() disposes shared ServiceCommands on tab switch; subsequent tab returns leak semaphores via the still-shared disposed engine (#1274)
* fix(manager): MainWindow.xaml.cs (Manager) - Five fire-and-forget '_ = AsyncMethod()' wrappers swallow exceptions silently; only one wrapper has a try/catch (#1275)
* fix(manager): App.xaml.cs - CustomConfigAction parses RefreshIntervalInSeconds/etc. without bounds-checking; zero or negative values crash the timer-creating VMs at startup (#1276)
* fix(manager): ConsoleViewModel.cs - Mixes injected IUiDispatcher with direct Application.Current.Dispatcher reads, breaking testability (#1277)
* fix(manager): WpfUiDispatcher.cs - YieldAsync uses Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher (per-thread), not the UI dispatcher; latent bug for any future background-thread caller (#1305)

* fix(manager): StatusConverter.cs - Convert/ConvertBack maps duplicated; null/unknown value masquerades as 'Not Installed' (#1421)
* fix(manager): App.xaml.cs (Manager) - ConsoleMaxLines upper bound is DefaultConsoleMaxLines*2 magic factor; deviates from sibling GetConfigInt calls (#1422)
* fix(manager): LogTailer.cs - File-not-found uses 3 different retry delays (1000ms / 500ms / 200ms) for similar transient conditions (#1423)
* fix(manager): LogLine.cs / LogTailer.cs - Timestamp Kind drifts: live tailing uses DateTime.Now (Local), history uses LastWriteTimeUtc (Utc) (#1424)
* fix(manager): LogTailer.cs - RunFromPosition byte tracking assumes Environment.NewLine, drifts on LF-only log files (#1455)
* fix(manager): Servy.Manager.Services.ServiceCommands.ImportConfigAsync - no CancellationToken throughout import chain; large/slow-network XML/JSON imports cannot be cancelled (#1483)
* fix(manager): LogTailer.LoadHistory - off-by-one drops the last N lines when file lacks a trailing newline (#1515)
* fix(manager): ServiceCommands.ExecuteServiceCommandAsync - Task.Run drops cancellationToken (inconsistent with InstallServiceAsync/UninstallServiceAsync siblings) (#1551)
* fix(cli): InstallServiceCommand - four ParseEnumOption defaults hardcoded as enum literals instead of AppConfig.Default* constants (#895)
* fix(cli): InstallServiceOptions.cs --params HelpText example uses singular --param= which the CLI does not accept (#964)
* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.SaveFile - reserved device name check bypassed by extra extension (e.g. NUL.config.json passes) (#991)
* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.SaveFile - comment says '8. Final Atomic Write' but File.WriteAllText is not atomic; Helper.WriteFileAtomic exists (#992)
* fix(cli): InstallServiceCommand - nine int.TryParse fallback lines should call ConfigParser.ParseInt (DRY) (#1035)
* fix(cli): ImportServiceCommand.ValidateServicePaths - hardcoded list of 11 path fields will silently miss new fields added to ServiceDto (#1036)
* fix(cli): ServiceInstallValidator depends on concrete ServiceValidationRules instead of IServiceValidationRules (#1107)
* fix(cli): ervy.CLI ServiceInstallValidator.Validate - reports first Warning before any Error, hiding the actually-blocking issue (#1108)
* fix(cli): Program.Main - AppDbContext is created but never Disposed; finally only disposes _secureData and Logger (#1127)
* fix(cli): Program.Main - Environment.Exit(1064) on SQLite version mismatch reuses Windows-service exit code (ERROR_EXCEPTION_IN_SERVICE) for a console-app exit (#1142)
* fix(cli): Program.cs - SQLite version-fail path uses Environment.Exit, skipping the finally block that flushes the logger (#1280)
* fix(cli): InstallServiceOptions.cs - Multiple copy-paste errors in XML doc summaries (process vs pre-launch/post-launch/pre-stop/post-stop) (#1288)

* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.cs - Enum.TryParse accepts numeric strings ('0'/'1') for ConfigFileType (same defect as #1283) (#1324)

* fix(cli): ImportServiceCommand.ProcessImportInternalAsync - File.ReadAllTextAsync ignores cancellationToken; cannot abort on slow/network paths (#1436)

* fix(cli): StartServiceCommand.ExecuteAsync - cancellationToken not propagated to StartServiceAsync (inconsistent with Stop/Restart) (#1474)
* fix(cli): ImportServiceCommand.ProcessXmlAsync - CancellationToken not forwarded; XML imports/installs are not cancellable while JSON ones are (#1540)
* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.ExecuteAsync - GetByNameAsync existence check missing CancellationToken (inconsistent with ExportXml/JsonAsync) (#1541)
* fix(cli,restarter,service): ProtectedKeyProvider is never disposed in CLI / Restarter / Service composition roots (cached unprotected key material leaks) (#1182)
* fix(cli,restarter,service): linker.xml duplicated across Servy.Service / Servy.Restarter (and 90% overlapping with Servy.CLI) (#1569)
* fix(psm1): Format-SecureLogMessage - docstring example output does not match actual output (says space-separated, but actual is '=' separated) (#951)
* fix(psm1): Invoke-ServyCli - synchronous stdout read can defeat ServyTimeoutSeconds (CLI may hang past timeout) (#987)
* fix(psm1): Export-ServyServiceConfig and Import-ServyServiceConfig - docstring claims 'Requires Administrator privileges' but Assert-Administrator is never called (#988)
* fix(psm1): identical ValidatePattern regex duplicated for EnvVars and PreLaunchEnv (DRY) (#1029)
* fix(psm1): $script:ServyTimeoutSeconds (600s) and $script:ServyMaxBufferChars (1MB) are hardcoded with no public way to override (#1043)
* fix(psm1): Format-SecureLogMessage line 186 inline regex comment has typo ("[\]*" should be "[^"]*") (#1052)

* fix(psm1): Add-Arg ArrayList 'performance' optimization is defeated by PowerShell pipeline unrolling on return (#1237)
* fix(psm1): Logging-&-Log-Rotation.md - Documents -DateRotationType 'None' option, but Install-ServyService [ValidateSet] only accepts Daily/Weekly/Monthly (#1240)
* fix(psm1): Invoke-ServyCli scrubs stderr (success path) and both streams (catch path) but leaves success-path stdout unscrubbed (#1299)
* fix(psm1): Buffer field named ByteCount actually accumulates char count (.Length), making truncation cap unit-ambiguous (#1402)
* fix(tests): CLI command tests - Hardcoded English message assertions break on any Strings.resx edit (#744)
* fix(publish): Five per-project publish.ps1 scripts each contain a near-identical Check-LastExitCode function (DRY) (#977)

* fix(publish): framework-dependent (publish-fd.ps1) invocation is commented out, leaving FD build orchestration dead code in the master entry script (#1149)
* fix(publish): signpath.ps1 - while-loop unloading the SignPath module relies on Remove-Module silently succeeding, infinite loop if removal is suppressed by -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue (#1150)

* fix(publish): publish-common.ps1 - Check-LastExitCode uses unapproved verb (PSScriptAnalyzer warning) (#1411)
* fix(publish): build-common.ps1 vs publish-common.ps1 - Two divergent definitions of Check-LastExitCode (one exits, one doesn't) (#1412)
* fix(publish): signpath.ps1 - Config key uppercased with culture-dependent ToUpper() (Turkish locale breaks 'I' keys) (#1413)
* fix(publish): tools-config.ps1 - Resolve-Tool returns env-var path without Test-Path validation, may return non-existent path (#1414)
* fix(bump-version): Get-ChildItem -Recurse on \$baseDir without bin/obj/.git/packages exclusion (same root cause as #1258, different file) (#1302)
* fix(bump-runtime): Get-ChildItem -Recurse on $baseDir without bin/obj/.git/packages exclusion can rewrite vendor and build-output files (#1258)
* fix(notifications): setup/taskschd/*.ps1 - dead PS 2.0 $PSScriptRoot fallback in scripts that already declare #Requires -Version 3.0+ (#955)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 - $serviceName not HTML-encoded in email body (only $logText is); subject also unscrubbed (#1031)

* fix(notifications): ServyFailureNotification.ps1 - Toast Tag/Group both set to 'Servy' causes new toasts to silently replace earlier ones in Action Center (#1044)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureNotification.ps1 - '#requires -Version 5.1' makes the PS 2.0 fallback at lines 126-132 unreachable (#1057)
* fix(notifications): ServySecurity.ps1 - broad 'KEY' keyword masks legitimate values like FOREIGN_KEY/PRIMARY_KEY (parallel impl of #1055) (#1058)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 - Protect-SensitiveString runs AFTER HTML encoding, defeating the quoted-string regex branch and leaking partial credentials (#1101)
* fix(notifications): Get-ServyLastErrors.ps1 - DateTime.Parse uses current-culture, locale-dependent date parsing of LastProcessed (#1146)
* fix(notifications): Get-ServyLastErrors.ps1 / ServyFailureEmail.ps1 / ServyFailureNotification.ps1 - fallback .log files use Out-File without -Encoding and grow unbounded forever (#1148)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureNotification.ps1 - Show-Notification references caller-scope $evt without declaring it as a parameter (#1180)
* fix(notifications): ServySecurity.ps1 - Protect-SensitiveString claims parity with C# MaskingRegex but is missing the space-separator and '/' branches; secrets in CLI args leak into email/toast notifications (#1196)

* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 - Watermark advances even when SMTP send fails; transient outages permanently lose alerts (#1252)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureNotification.ps1 - Watermark advances even when toast notification fails; transient errors permanently lose alerts (#1253)
* fix(notifications): Get-ServyLastErrors.ps1 / Servy-Watermark.psm1 - EVENT_ID_ERROR=3103 duplicated; consumers hardcode 3104 instead of using exported constants (#1254)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 - 'break' inside switch inside foreach exits switch only, foreach keeps processing on transient SMTP failure (#1344)
* fix(notifications): taskschd .vbs and .xml files hardcode 'C:\Program Files\Servy' - tasks break on custom install paths (#1345)
* fix(notifications): ServySecurity.ps1 - Protect-SensitiveString masking regex has no timeout, vulnerable to ReDoS via nested quantifiers (#1368)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 - Catch-all classifies permanent SmtpExceptions (auth failure, invalid recipient) as TransientFailure, causing watermark stall (#1384)
* fix(notifications): Servy-Watermark.psm1 - Silently loads with Write-Warning when Get-ServyLastErrors.ps1 / Write-ServyLog.ps1 are missing, causing 'command not found' at runtime (#1385)
* fix(notifications): Servy-Watermark.psm1 - $EVENT_ID_ERROR_DEP declared but never used (#1394)

* fix(notifications): Write-ServyLog.ps1 - rotatedFilePath variable computed but never used (dead code) (#1410)
* fix(Get-FileEncoding): Get-FileEncoding.ps1 - ReadAllBytes loads entire file into memory just to inspect 3-byte BOM (#1136)
* fix(bump-runtime): Get-FileEncoding only detects UTF-8 BOM, while bump-version.ps1's identical-name helper also detects UTF-16 LE/BE BOMs (#979)
* fix(bump-runtime): .EXAMPLE comments reference 'update-runtime.ps1' but actual file name is 'bump-runtime.ps1' (#1135)
* fix(bump-runtime): regex 'net\d+\.\d+' will partially replace inside three-segment versions like 'net10.0.1', mangling the version (#1532)

* fix(bump-version): local $matches assignment shadows PowerShell automatic variable (#950)

* fix(bump-version): csproj loop is silent on no-match (unlike Update-FileContent helper) (#1002)
* fix(bump-version): Write-Error does not terminate the script, allowing silent partial failures across version bump steps (#1198)
* fix(docs): Environment-Variables.md - verification recipe uses 'cmd.exe /c set > ... && pause' which makes the service hang in Session 0 (no console = pause never returns) (#1151)
* ci(test): Notify Codecov/Coveralls comments are posted on CLOSED issues, so maintainers receive no notification (#1096)
* ci(test): test.yml - Invoke-Expression to run dotnet test command is unnecessary and an injection-prone anti-pattern (#1262)

* ci(publish): 'dotnet tool install --global CycloneDX' has no version pin (#851)
* ci(publish): unit tests run in Debug while artifacts ship from Release; release-only regressions slip through CI (#862)
* ci(publish): 'Cool down API' step uses legacy 'powershell' shell instead of 'pwsh' (inconsistent with every other step) (#1082)
* ci(publish): initial 'Build Servy projects' phase rebuilds every project that is then re-built via 'dotnet publish' later (wasted work + risk of stale artifacts) (#1083)
* ci(publish): Initial dotnet build runs in Debug while rest of workflow is Release (wasted CI time) (#1181)
* fix(publish): publish-common.ps1 - New-PortablePackage comment 'compress contents of the folder, not the folder itself' contradicts the actual 7-Zip invocation which includes the folder itself (#1226)
* ci(setup-dotnet): .github/actions/setup-dotnet/action.yml - 'version' input + DOTNET_VERSION env are dead; install version actually comes from global.json (#1261)
* ci(publish): publish.yml - Copy-Item -Recurse -Exclude does not match files in subdirectories (same bug as #1200, different file; also packages portable 7z) (#1303)
* ci(choco): chocolateyuninstall.ps1 - 'Servy*' wildcard lookup mis-handles multi-match case (silent partial uninstall) (#1340)
* ci(security): 'Scan for vulnerable packages' uses legacy 'powershell' shell instead of 'pwsh' (parallels #1082) (#1097)
* ci(security): Concurrency block commented out (lines 26-28); either delete or activate (#1098)
* ci(release): 'changelog' workflow triggers this run but is missing from the validation list (asymmetry) (#1099)
* ci(dotnet-reflection): comment claims 'disabled' but workflow_dispatch is still active; also typo 'worflow' and commented-out triggers (#1100)

* ci(loc): loc.yml - 'Create total LoC badge' step uses 'curl -s' without -f or exit-code check; shields.io HTTP errors are silently published as the LoC total badge (#1313)
* ci: five workflow files saved as Windows-1252 (Non-ISO extended-ASCII) instead of UTF-8, breaking YAML 1.2 spec and rendering em-dashes as mojibake (#954)
* chore(deps): update dependencies

* fix(core): ProcessHelper.GetProcessTreeMetrics - caps summed CPU at 100%, hides multi-core saturation (#829)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.EscapeArgument - fails to double backslashes that precede an internal quote (Win32 CommandLineToArgvW corruption) (#827)
* fix(core): Logger.cs - MaxBackupFiles is hardcoded to 0 (unlimited), no admin override path (#838)
* fix(core): SecureData.Decrypt - on crypto failure of marked payload, returns the post-marker payload (not the documented 'original cipherText') (#848)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.GetOrGenerate - comment claims 'exponential backoff' but Thread.Sleep math is linear (#852)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.cs - EscapeProcessArgument is dead code; only the broken EscapeArgument is called (#857)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.SaveProtected - WindowsIdentity from GetCurrent() is never disposed (handle leak per save) (#861)
* fix(core): SecurityHelper.CreateSecureDirectory - WindowsIdentity from GetCurrent() never disposed (handle leak per call) (#868)
* fix(core): LogonAsServiceGrant.Ensure - InvalidOperationException loses the underlying SID-resolution failure cause (#874)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper + ServiceExporter - non-atomic file writes can leave truncated/partial files on crash, mid-copy interruption, or disk full (#875)
* fix(core): SecurityHelper.ApplySecurityRules - comparing the current user's SID to BuiltinAdministrators/LocalSystem GROUP SIDs is meaningless (#933)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.KillProcessTreeAndParents(string) - silent catch-all swallows ALL errors with no logging (#935)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.KillProcessTree - uses stale 'allProcesses' snapshot during recursion; processes spawned mid-walk survive (#936)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.TerminateBlockingProcesses - for .exe resources, kills ALL processes matching the filename, including unrelated instances belonging to other services (#938)
* fix(core): Logger.Log - bare 'catch { /* Fail-silent */ }' on the write path swallows every I/O exception with no fallback channel (#940)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.GetAllServices - orphaned PopulateNativeDetails task races with results consumer and uses scmHandle after dispose (#965)
* fix(core): EventLogReader.ReadEvents - materializes the entire result set in memory before MaxResults limit can apply (#970)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.Info/Warn/Error - EventLog.WriteEntry calls have no try/catch and no length truncation (32766-char limit) (#971)
* fix(core): ServiceControllerWrapper.BuildDependencyTree - bare catch swallows every error with no logging, leaving '(Unavailable)' nodes indistinguishable (#972)
* fix(infra): ServiceRepository.cs - XmlSerializer instantiated per export, leaks dynamic assemblies (#816)
* fix(infra): ServiceRepository.UpsertBatchAsync - IN clause uses default BINARY collation while upsert key is LOWER(Name); ID sync misses case-mismatched rows (#820)
* fix(infra): ServiceRepository.SearchAsync - Name LIKE `@Pattern` is case-sensitive for non-ASCII characters; rest of the repo uses LOWER(...) = LOWER(...) (#881)
* fix(service): ProcessWrapper.cs - CancelOutputRead/CancelErrorRead missing ThrowIfDisposed check (#800)
* fix(service): ServiceHelper.cs - duplicate using Servy.Core.Config directive (#802)
* fix(service): CheckHealth handler never -= from _healthCheckTimer before Dispose, delegate leak on each restart cycle (#803)
* fix(service): fileSemaphore and _healthCheckSemaphore never disposed, kernel handle leak on teardown (#807)
* fix(service): ProcessLauncher.ApplyLanguageFixes - substring match on 'python'/'java' in FileName produces false positives (#834)
* fix(service): ProcessWrapper.WaitUntilRunningAsync - always waits the full timeout, never returns 'running' early (#858)
* fix(service): ProcessLauncher.Start - TimeoutMs silently ignored when OnScmHeartbeat is null (#860)
* fix(service): truncated XML doc tag '/// \<pa' on the unit-test constructor (#889)
* fix(service): ServiceHelper - SensitiveKeyWords list and MaskingRegex pattern are out of sync (CREDENTIAL / CONNECTIONSTRING / CERTIFICATE missing from regex) (#896)
* fix(service): ServiceHelper.MaskSensitiveValue - substring-based keyword match flags non-secret env-var names (e.g. MONKEY, APIPATH, PRIVATELY) (#929)
* fix(service): ProcessLauncher.Start - synchronous launch with TimeoutMs == 0 falls into unbounded WaitForExit() and can hang the service (#952)
* fix(service): ProcessExtensions.GetChildren / GetAllDescendants - bare catch swallows ALL errors with no logging (parallel to #935) (#975)
* fix(service): ProcessLaunchOptions.TimeoutMs - XML doc says 0 = infinite wait but ProcessLauncher.Start throws ArgumentException when TimeoutMs \<= 0 (#976)
* fix(desktop): add None date rotation type (#812)
* fix(desktop,manager): all ViewModels coupled to Application.Current - cannot instantiate in tests (#429)
* fix(desktop,manager): ViewModels directly use Mouse.OverrideCursor - fails without WPF context (#431)
* fix(desktop,manager): FileSystemWatcher event handlers never unsubscribed before Dispose (#804)
* fix(desktop,manager): AsyncCommand.Execute - async void with no try/catch propagates exceptions to the WPF dispatcher and can crash the UI (#866)
* fix(desktop,manager): MainWindow.OnClosed (Servy + Manager) - Process.GetCurrentProcess() handle never disposed (#873)
* fix(manager): ServiceCommands.cs - SearchServicesAsync does not filter nulls returned by ToModelAsync (#797)
* fix(manager): ProcessHelper calls made without _metricsLock held, inconsistent with MainViewModel (#799)
* fix(manager): ConsoleViewModel / PerformanceViewModel - StopMonitoring hides base virtual method instead of overriding it (#808)
* fix(manager): MonitoringViewModelBase.OnTick - async void handler does not wrap OnTickAsync in try/catch; an unhandled exception will crash the WPF dispatcher (#982)
* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.cs - new Uri(fullPath) throws UriFormatException on legitimate paths (#815)
* fix(cli,psm1): DateRotationType.None missing from documented enum values (#812)
* fix(cli):  ExportServiceCommand - ReservedPortRegex misses COM0/LPT0 (and Unicode-superscript COM¹/LPT¹/etc.) per current Microsoft naming docs (#900)
* fix(psm1): Servy.psd1 - AliasesToExport declared twice; line 85 empty array overwrites line 76 entries (#811)
* fix(psm1): Assert-Administrator - WindowsIdentity from GetCurrent() never disposed (handle leak per call) (#864)
* fix(psm1): Invoke-ServyCli - finally block calls process.WaitForExit() with no timeout; if Kill() failed, PowerShell hangs forever (#879)
* fix(psm1): Install-ServyService - dead 'if ($paramName -eq "Password") { continue }' guard (no '--password' entry exists in $paramMapping) (#891)
* fix(tests): ProcessHelper and ProcessKiller are static - cannot be mocked (#430)
* fix(tests): multiple test files - Mock-only tests verify Moq dispatch, not production code (#552)
* fix(tests): TestableService - 16 reflection hops into Service private members with silent null-forgiving (#742)
* fix(tests): test fixtures - 13 occurrences of maintainer-specific Python path (C:\Users\aelassas\...) (#753)
* fix(iss): NumericVersion drops patch component, mis-classifies upgrade vs reinstall (#817)
* fix(publish): 8 publish-res scripts are structurally identical (~800 lines) (#406)
* fix(publish): signpath.ps1 - API token stored in plaintext file with no ACL guidance (#583)
* fix(notifications): Get-ServyLastErrors.ps1 - Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable requires PS 3.0+, contradicts script's "PowerShell 2.0 or later" header (#805)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 --claims PowerShell 2.0 compatibility but dot-sources a script that #Requires -Version 3.0 (#836)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 / ServyFailureNotification.ps1 - masking regex lacks word boundaries, can mangle non-secret content (#837)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 / Get-ServyLastErrors.ps1 - DateTime.Parse on watermark/parameters is culture-sensitive while the file is written invariant ISO 8601 (#863)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 - SmtpClient is never disposed; comment about 'PS 2.0 / .NET 3.5' is incorrect (#884)
* fix(notifications): Get-ServyLastErrors.ps1 - fallback log file is named 'ServyFailureEmail.log' (copy-paste from sibling script) (#926)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 and ServyFailureNotification.ps1 - concurrent watermark re-read uses bare [DateTime]::Parse instead of ParseExact, can silently misinterpret Kind under non-en-US culture (#945)
* fix(bump-runtime): TFM regex 'net\d+\.\d+' lacks word boundary, can match inside larger tokens (#844)
* ci(bump-version): ValidatePattern rejects 3-segment versions but help text claims they are supported (#843)
* ci(bump-version): silently 'succeeds' when regex pattern fails to match (no replacements) (#885)
* ci(scoop): gh CLI authenticates via GH_PAT but gh reads GH_TOKEN; merged-PR duplicate check is a silent no-op (#886)
* ci(choco): retry loop around 'git push' never retries because PowerShell try/catch does not catch non-zero exit from native commands (#887)
* chore(deps): updated dependencies
