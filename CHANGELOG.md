# Servy fork — Changelog

> Hard fork of [aelassas/servy](https://github.com/aelassas/servy). This top section records **fork-specific** changes. Upstream Servy's full release history is preserved below under [Changelog (upstream)](#changelog-upstream). Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased] — fork

### Added
- `VISION.md` — architecture-of-record for the cross-platform / multi-arch / Velopack-integration direction.

### Changed
- Fork-forward rewrite of `README.md`, `NOTES.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` to establish the fork's identity and vision; `setup/*/README.md` de-branded as fork local-test notes.
- Repository hardening / lockdown — branch + tag rulesets, SHA-pinned GitHub Actions.
- Branch model for at-will upstream sync: `vnext` is the locked default branch (all fork work + the protection ruleset); the upstream mirror (first created as `main`, **renamed to `upstream-main`**) is a pristine, unprotected mirror of `upstream/main`, synced on demand via `git fetch upstream && git push origin upstream/main:upstream-main`. The fork's `build`/`test`/`security`/`loc` workflows run on `vnext`; the upstream `sonar` (SonarCloud) workflow does not run in the fork. Renaming the mirror off `main` stops it from re-running (and failing) upstream's `main`-triggered CI on every sync.
- CI resilience: the `test` workflow now retries flaky upstream integration tests (ProcessKiller file-lock termination, ProcessLauncher output multiplexing) up to 3× so transient runner-timing failures self-heal, and the ARM64 leg is now advisory (`continue-on-error`) since the fork does not ship ARM64 yet — only `Test (x64)` gates `vnext`. README build/test badges retargeted to `?branch=vnext`.
- CI: CodeQL (the `Static Analysis (CodeQL)` job in the `security` workflow) now runs on push-to-`vnext` + the weekly schedule only — **not on `pull_request`**. PR-time CodeQL gated each merge on GitHub's code-scanning backend finishing SARIF processing; on a large upstream-absorb PR that processing stalled ~30 min, leaving the `github-advanced-security` `CodeQL` check queued indefinitely and blocking auto-merge even though it is not a required status check. The post-merge push to `vnext` stays the authoritative scan (squash-merge fork); Dependency + Secret scanning still run on PRs.

### Notes
- The fork tracks upstream `main` (last synced to `6a3ef98bd`, 2026-07-01, post-8.5) and is otherwise **code-identical to upstream** — only documentation and CI triggers diverge, no product behavior. Released, signed Windows binaries come from upstream.

* fix(core): Servy.Core/Helpers/StringHelper.cs vs EscapedTokenizer.cs - Escape emits letter sequences \r/\n, but Unescape only recognizes literal CR/LF bytes; CR/LF in env-var values is lost on round-trip (#1920)
* fix(core): RotatingStreamWriter.cs - CloseWriter abandons _writer/_baseStream if Flush throws, leaking handles and wedging future writes/Dispose (#1928)

* fix(core): HandleHelper.GetProcessesUsingFile - RegexMatchTimeoutException escapes the try/catch because MatchCollection enumerates lazily (#2079)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.ResolvePath - legitimate paths containing literal '%X%' segments are rejected as 'unexpanded variable' when the file does not yet exist on disk (#2082)
* fix(core): NativeMethodsHelpers.ValidateCredentials - username regex allows newline / tab / NBSP via \s, producing misleading downstream errors (#2089)
* fix(core): ServiceHelper.CalculateStopTimeout - uncapped previousStopTimeout lets one abnormal stop poison every subsequent stop (#2091)
* fix(core): Helper.IsValidPath - uses Path.GetInvalidPathChars(), accepting filename-invalid chars like '<', '>', '|', '*', '?' that cause downstream open failures (#2106)
* fix(core): ServiceHelper.StopServices - no InvalidOperationException fallback like StartServices, so a benign race (service already stopped by another caller) is reported as an error (#2111)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.UninstallServiceAsync - pre-uninstall ChangeServiceConfig(DEMAND_START) is not rolled back when stop/delete fails, leaving the service silently switched to Manual (#2115)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.InstallServiceAsync - CREATE path applies PreShutdown then DelayedStart; UPDATE path applies them in opposite order (#2121)
* fix(core): NativeMethodsHelpers.GetFileIdentity - PrefixDigest never incorporates fs.Length, contradicting the inline comment; two rotated logs with identical 4096-byte prefixes hash to the same digest and rotation is missed (#2130)
* fix(core): EventLogService.SearchAsync - startDate/endDate with DateTimeKind.Unspecified silently shifts the filter window by the local UTC offset (#2131)
* fix(core): Logger.cs Log - sanitized message keeps '[' and ']', allowing log-line forgery via service name / process output (CWE-117) (#2132)
* fix(core): ImportGuard / ExportServiceCommand - reserved-device check misses trailing-space variants (sibling of #2069) (#2141)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.SaveProtected - File.Move lacks AV/EDR retry that Helper.WriteFileAtomic has (#2152)
* fix(core): ServiceControllerWrapper.BuildDependencyTree - currentPath cycle check is O(n) per node → O(n^2) for deep dependency chains (#2163)
* fix(core): EventLogReader.MapToDto - ArgumentOutOfRangeException from 'new DateTimeOffset(evt.TimeCreated.Value)' is not caught; the in-code comment claims it is, but the fallback only fires when TimeCreated has NO value (#2170)
* fix(core): Helper.IsServiceNameValid - char.IsControl misses Unicode format category (ZWSP, RLO, LRM), allowing invisible/bidi chars in service names (#2171)
* fix(core): Logger.Log - single-line sanitization does not strip Unicode line separators (U+2028, U+2029), partially defeating the scannability guarantee (#2172)
* fix(core): IServiceManager - IsServiceInstalled and GetDependencies lack CancellationToken, asymmetric with sibling interface methods (#2176)
* fix(core): ScopedEventLogLogger.SetIsEventLogEnabled(true) silently no-ops if parent's _eventLog was never initialized (#2182)

* fix(core): ServiceDtoHelper.ApplyDefaultsAndResetIdentity silently discards UserAccount/Password from XML/JSON imports with no operator-visible warning (#2184)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.CriticalSystemProcesses - missing Windows 10+ pseudo-system processes (Registry, MemCompression) (#2187)

* fix(core): ServiceHelper.StartServices - StopPending/PausePending services skip Start()/Continue() and then time out polling for Running (#2025)
* fix(core): WindowsServiceInfo.cs - XML doc cref references non-existent IWindowsServiceProvider; should be IWindowsServiceApi (#2030)
* fix(core): HandleHelper.GetProcessesUsingFile - timeout path's TimeoutException reports possibly-truncated stderr because async readers are not drained before throwing (#2043)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.MapStartupType - log message says 'Falling back to Manual' but the code returns ServiceStartType.Unknown (#2050)
* fix(core): AppConfig.cs - FindRepoRoot XML doc says 'only available in DEBUG builds' but the method is compiled and called in Release tests (#2084)
* fix(core): AppFoldersHelper.EnsureFolders - XML doc promises InvalidOperationException for malformed connection strings, but DbConnectionStringBuilder throws ArgumentException (#2090)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.RestartServiceAsync - Stop failure reason discarded; caller sees generic 'Failed to restart' instead of the real cause (#2122)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.CopyEmbeddedResource - restart failure after successful copy returns false, so caller logs 'failed to extract embedded resource' for a copy that actually succeeded (#2124)
* fix(core): InstallServiceOptions - five nullable int?/bool? fields are asymmetric with non-nullable siblings; null leaks downstream because two of three call sites forget to apply '?? Default' (#2126)
* fix(core): ServiceHelper.cs StartServices - polling loop ignores Stopped state, mis-reports crashed-during-start as 'timed out waiting' (#2133)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.GetProcessTree - inline parentToChildren snapshot duplicates Toolhelp32Snapshot.BuildSnapshotAndChildMap (#2146)
* fix(core): ServiceAccounts / GetLogOnAsDisplayName - LocalSystem has a 4-alias set but LocalService and NetworkService only match the canonical 'NT AUTHORITY\…' form (#2147)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.KillProcessesUsingFile - invokes KillProcessTreeAndParents with default killParents=true, terminating unrelated parent processes that are not holding the file lock (#2048)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.InstallServiceAsync - cancellation between CreateService and the try/catch rollback block leaves an orphan SCM entry with no DB record (#2049)
* fix(core): EventLogReader.MapToDto - only FormatDescription is guarded; Id/Level/ProviderName/TimeCreated can throw EventLogException and abort the entire enumeration (#2061)
* fix(core): EventLogReader.ReadEvents - for-loop fetches one extra EventRecord past maxReadCount; a throw on that read aborts the whole batch the caller had already received (#2139)
* fix(core): StringHelper.FormatServiceDependencies - XML doc and nullable return type both promise null, but method never returns null (#2157)
* fix(core): StringHelper.Escape / EscapedTokenizer.Unescape - round-trip is broken for \r and \n in env-var values (#2158)
* fix(core): EnvironmentVariableParser.Parse - value trim-then-unescape is asymmetric with key unescape-then-trim, drops escaped trailing whitespace in values (#2159)

* fix(core): EventLogService.SearchAsync - comment claims 'records is a fully-materialized DTO sequence' but ReadEvents is a lazy yield-based iterator (#2161)
* fix(core): ConfigParser.ParseBool - only accepts 'True'/'False', rejects common config-file boolean variants ('1', '0', 'yes', 'no', 'on', 'off') (#2162)
* fix(core): EnvironmentVariablesValidator.Validate - short-circuits on first error, asymmetric with sibling ServiceDependenciesValidator which collects all errors (#2164)
* fix(core):  ProcessHelper.cs - UnexpandedEnvVarRegex static field declared but never referenced (dead code) (#2165)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.ScopedEventLogLogger.CreateScoped - nested-prefix bracket-balancing trick ("{Prefix}] [{prefix}") silently breaks when a prefix contains '[' or ']' (#2166)
* fix(core): Domain/Service.cs - XML doc <returns> on Start/Stop/Restart/Install/Uninstall describe a bool result but methods return OperationResult (#2168)

* fix(core): Domain/Service.cs - IsInstalled() and GetServiceStartupType() do not accept CancellationToken, breaking propagation from callers (#2177)
* fix(core): Logger.cs - now/tzMarker timestamp formatting duplicated across three sites (DRY) (#2185)
* fix(core): NativeMethods.PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION has 3 Reserved2_* fields where Win32 defines only Reserved2[2]; layout is 1 IntPtr larger than the OS struct, so UniqueProcessId would read garbage if NtQueryInformationProcess is ever wired up (#2198)
* fix(core): ServiceStartType.cs - XML doc cref references nonexistent 'AutoStart' member (should be 'Automatic') (#2200)
* fix(core): nstallServiceOptions.cs - XML doc / HelpText for Pre-Stop / Post-Launch / Post-Stop StartupDir contradict the actual fallback in Service.cs (#2208)
* fix(core): ServiceHelper.CalculateStartTimeout - does not account for PreLaunchRetryAttempts, causing 'Timed out waiting to start' for services with configured pre-launch retries (#2211)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.SaveProtected - crash between WriteAllBytes and File.Move leaves encrypted .tmp files orphaned with elevated ACLs; subsequent runs never clean them up (#2213)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.KillParentProcesses - recursive call passes stale parentStartTime (possibly MinValue) instead of verified exactStartTime, silently truncating the upward walk one level (#2214)
* fix(core): ImportGuard.ValidatePathSecurity - ReadToEnd has no size guard and runs before every caller's size check, so a giant import file OOMs the process before MaxConfigFileSizeMB rejects it (#2220)
* fix(core): SecurityHelper.CreateSecureDirectory - race-window comment is misleading; ACE purge does not mitigate handle-retention or squat attacks during the TOCTOU window (#2224)
* fix(core): XmlServiceSerializer vs ServiceExporter - divergent XmlSerializer caching and BOM encoding for identical ServiceDto XML pipeline (#2227)
* fix(core): ServiceDto.EnableDebugLogs XML doc claims data goes to Windows Event Log; actual destination is the local Servy.Service.log file (#2228)
* fix(core): DateRotationType.cs - XML doc claims 'per calendar day/week/month (local)' but RotatingStreamWriter defaults to UTC (useLocalTimeForRotation=false) (#2231)
* fix(core): SecurityHelper.ApplySecurityRules - DACL purge only removes Allow ACEs for Users/AuthenticatedUsers/Everyone; pre-squatted directory keeps attacker-added explicit Allow ACE (local privilege escalation) (#2235)
* fix(core): EnvironmentVariablesValidator.Validate accepts env-var values that EnvironmentVariableParser.Parse later rejects with FormatException (missing newline-validation parity) (#2238)
* fix(core): ReservedNames.cs - COM0/LPT0 are not Windows reserved device names; over-restriction rejects valid names and XML doc 'ports (0-9)' is wrong (#2240)
* fix(core): ServiceControllerWrapper.BuildDependencyTree - fullyExpanded memoization reuses path-dependent cycle placeholders, mislabeling shared/diamond dependencies as cyclic (#2241)
* fix(core): SecureData.cs DecryptV2 - corrupted v2 Base64 throws FormatException, not the documented SecureDataIntegrityException (#2242)
* fix(core): EventLogLevel.Verbose is preserved by ParseLevel but excluded from the Logs filter - asymmetric with Critical (folded into Error) (#2246)
* fix(core): ServiceDependenciesParser.Parse - nullable return type string? but the method never returns null (#2254)

* fix(core): EventLogReader.ParseLevel - XML doc says 'Verbose is preserved' but Verbose (level 5) is folded into Information (#2259)
* fix(core): NativeMethodsHelpers.GetFileIdentity - comment says '4-byte-len' but BitConverter.GetBytes(fs.Length) emits an 8-byte long (#2261)
* fix(core): RotatingStreamWriter.WriteInternal - lock-timeout log says 'drop current line' but the line is actually written (#2269)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.GetCachedOrGenerate - XML doc promises 'a clone' but the generate path returns the original array (only the fast path clones) (#2270)
* fix(core): SecurityHelper.ApplySecurityRules - XML doc claims current user is skipped when in 'System or Admin groups' but code only excludes LocalSystem (#2271)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.GetServiceStartupType - inlines delayed-auto-start query that IsDelayedStart already encapsulates (DRY) (#2275)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.SaveProtected - fixed staging file assumes mutex protection, but the v7.8 migration re-save runs outside the mutex (#2276)

* fix(core): ServiceManager.cs - AutomaticDelayedStart→Automatic start-type coercion duplicated in CreateService and UpdateServiceConfig (#2288)
* fix(core): EventLogService.cs - SearchAsync truncates to MaxResults before ordering; with default oldest-first reads the most recent events are never returned (#2295)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.ShouldCopyResource - 'embeddedResourceTime' variable and debug log actually report the host executable's timestamp, not the embedded resource's (#2301)
* fix(core): Logger.cs - FormatException emits an unmatched trailing ']' for every formatted exception (off-by-one in structural-bracket balancing) (#2307)
* fix(core): EventLogReader.ReadEvents - the (maxReadCount+1)th EventRecord is read by the for-loop increment but never disposed, leaking a native handle (#2310)
* fix(core): ServiceDependenciesValidator.cs - XML doc summary omits the dollar sign '$' that the regex and inline comment allow (#2317)
* fix(core): IServiceManager.cs - GetDependencies XML doc claims reverse dependencies are returned, but implementation only resolves ServicesDependedOn (#2327)
* fix(core): IServiceManager.cs / ServiceManager.cs - InstallServiceAsync documents ArgumentNullException but actually throws ArgumentException for missing names/paths (#2328)
* fix(core): InstallServiceOptions.cs - EnableDateRotation doc uses <paramref name="dateRotationType"> referencing a nonexistent parameter (#2329)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.cs - StartServiceAsync/StopServiceAsync repository-null guard throws a misleading "Cannot install service" message (copy-paste) (#2330)

* fix(infra): ServiceRepository.PatchRuntimeStateAsync/PatchRuntimeState - sync and async siblings duplicated verbatim (drift risk) (#1608)
* fix(infra): ServiceRepository.DecryptDto - mid-loop decryption failure leaves DTO half-decrypted, mixed plaintext + ciphertext returned to caller (#1609)

* fix(service): EnvironmentVariableHelper.ProtectedVariables - missing DOTNET_DiagnosticPorts and other CLR/.NET diagnostic injection vectors (#2037)
* fix(service): Service.cs HandleStopResult - XML doc claims null means 'timed out' but timeout no longer routes through HandleStopResult (#2046)
* fix(service): Service.cs StartProcess - assigns caller-supplied environmentVariables to _environmentVariables field without null guard, can NRE on RestartProcess (#2047)
* fix(service): Service.cs OnCustomCommand - fallback path calls Environment.Exit without flushing the logger, losing the diagnostic messages it just wrote (#2052)
* fix(service): Service.cs hook framework - only Pre-Launch supports dedicated environment variables; Pre-Stop / Post-Launch / Post-Stop / Failure Program reuse the main service envs (#2053)
* fix(service): Service.cs HandleLogWriters - stderr path is passed to Helper.Canonicalise before _pathValidator.IsValidPath runs, so a malformed StdErrPath throws and crashes OnStart (#2068)
* fix(service): Service.cs MakeFilenameSafe - does not strip trailing spaces/periods, allowing two distinct service names to collide on the same restartAttempts file (#2069)
* fix(service): Service.cs PersistProcessState - read-modify-write of full DTO with preserveExistingCredentials:false overwrites concurrent password/parameter updates from Servy.Manager (#2070)

* fix(service): Service.cs InitiateRecoveryAsync - _healthCheckSemaphore.WaitAsync uses no CancellationToken, throws ObjectDisposedException if teardown disposes the semaphore mid-wait (#2097)
* fix(service): Service.cs CleanupTrackedHooks - single try/catch wraps the whole foreach, so one hook.Dispose() throw leaks every remaining hook (#2098)
* fix(service): Service.cs ExecuteRecoveryAction - XML doc summary describes InitiateRecoveryAsync's responsibilities, not its own (#2099)

* fix(service): Service.cs - Redundant nested 'if (!recoveryTriggered)' in ScheduleRecoveryAsync (dead guard) (#2263)
* fix(service): Service.cs - ExecuteRecoveryAction swallows all exceptions, making InitiateRecoveryAsync's failure handling dead code (recovery gate never reopens on failed terminal action) (#2265)
* fix(service): Service.cs OnStart - health-monitoring fields (_maxFailedChecks, _recoveryAction, _heartbeatIntervalSeconds) are initialized in SetupHealthMonitoring AFTER the child process and its Exited handler are wired up, creating a startup race (#2266)

* fix(service): EnvironmentVariableHelper.cs - dictionary-builder OS expansion lacks the injected-% protection the string overload uses, re-expanding literal percent content (#2300)
* fix(service): Service.cs - RunFailureProgram has a truncated comment "// 1. Prepare Environment and" (#2302)
* fix(service): Service.cs - PRESHUTDOWN failure path sets ExitCode=1066 but UpdateServiceStatus hardcodes dwWin32ExitCode/dwServiceSpecificExitCode to 0, so SCM records a clean stop (#2305)

* fix(restarter): ServiceRestarter.RestartService - throws System.TimeoutException internally but lets System.ServiceProcess.TimeoutException propagate from WaitForStatus, two unrelated exception types for the same logical timeout (#2083)
* fix(restarter): Program.cs Main - finally block disposal cascade is not exception-safe; one Dispose() throw skips Logger.Shutdown() and remaining cleanup (#2109)
* fix(restarter): ServiceRestarter.RestartService - pending-state settle loop is not protected against InvalidOperationException/Win32Exception from a deleted-mid-flight service, inconsistent with Stop/Start phases (#2110)
* fix(restarter): ServiceRestarter.RestartService - start-phase controller.Status read (line 90) is unguarded, unlike the settle phase, so a service uninstalled between stop and start throws an unhandled exception (#2298)
* fix(restarter): Program.cs - step '3. Configure the GLOBAL logging' comment sits above the restart-timeout parse, not the logging setup (#2347)
* fix(restarter): IServiceRestarter.cs - RestartService XML doc omits the 'timeout' parameter (impl uses inheritdoc, so the gap propagates) (#2348)
* fix(restarter): Servy.Restarter/publish.ps1 - comment-based help documents a -Version parameter that the param() block does not declare (#2358)
* fix(ui): AppBootstrapper.cs - resource disposal order does not match reverse-of-construction (same family as #1202) (#1498)

* fix(ui): ServiceCommands.cs - GUI ImportConfigAsync lacks UNC/reparse/protected-folder guards that CLI ImportServiceCommand enforces (#1861)
* fix(ui): AppBootstrapper.cs - hardcoded English MessageBox for missing handle.exe, while sibling failures use Strings.resx (#1923)
* fix(ui,core): App.xaml.cs (Servy, Servy.Manager) and ProcessHelper.cs - three more sites use Path.IsPathRooted as an 'is absolute' check (follow-up to #1849) (#1866)
* fix(ui): ImportGuard.cs and ExportServiceCommand.cs - same Contains("\UNC\") false-positive as #1875, but in two more files (#1879)
* fix(ui): AppBootstrapper.cs - OnExit calls CleanupAvailabilityWatcher() outside TryRun, breaking deterministic cleanup if Dispose throws (#1886)

* fix(ui): MainWindow.OnClosed calls Logger.Shutdown() before App.OnExit, silently dropping disposal warnings (#2027)
* fix(ui): AppBootstrapper.cs - FileSystemWatcher.Error in availability monitor only logs; does not refresh state, leaving UI stale after a buffer overflow (#2036)
* fix(ui): HelpService.CheckUpdates - HttpResponseMessage from GetAsync is never disposed, leaking the response object and pinning pooled connections longer than necessary (#2045)
* fix(ui): DesignTimeMocks.cs - DesignTimeServiceRepository declares duplicate GetByName overload that isn't on IServiceRepository (#2085)
* fix(ui): AsyncCommand.Execute - OperationCanceledException logged as Error, inconsistent with ServiceManager and noisy on user cancel (#2094)

* fix(manager): DependenciesViewModel.LoadDependencyTreeAsync - DependencyTree.Clear() runs before SelectedService null-check, causing UI flash when no service is selected (#2041)
* fix(manager): MainViewModel / LogsViewModel / DependenciesViewModel - Interlocked CTS-swap pattern races between Dispose and newCts.Token read, can throw ObjectDisposedException (#2042)
* fix(manager): LogTailer.RunFromPosition - position tracker uses reader.CurrentEncoding.GetByteCount, mis-counts on non-UTF8 BOM-less files and can drop bytes on transient error (#2064)
* fix(manager): PerformanceViewModel.cs - Task.Run drops CancellationToken in OnTickAsync, asymmetric with Servy.Manager ServiceMapper.ToModelAsync (#2081)
* fix(manager): ServiceMapper.GetLogOnAsDisplayName - does not recognize NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM / .\LocalSystem aliases for the LocalSystem account, leaks raw SCM string into the UI (#2087)
* fix(manager): MainWindow.xaml.cs RunAsync / MainTabControl_SelectionChangedAsync - OperationCanceledException logged as Error on every tab switch / window close (#2096)

* fix(cli): InstallServiceOptions.cs - XML doc 'Possible values' lists out of sync with [Option] HelpText (missing AutomaticDelayedStart, missing None) (#1656)
* fix(cli): Servy.CLI/Program.cs - Run() extracts embedded resources on every invocation, including --help and --version (#1760)
* fix(cli): ImportServiceCommand -> ServiceValidationRules - validator calls NativeMethods.ValidateCredentials (LogonUser) on imported user/password, but the deserializer immediately resets them to LocalSystem; failed imports can lock out the target account for nothing (#1781)
* fix(cli): ImportServiceCommand.cs - input path lacks the UNC block and junction/symlink resolution that ExportServiceCommand applies; admin imports can silently pull from \attacker\share via a junction (#1783)
* fix(cli): ImportServiceCommand.cs / ExportServiceCommand.cs - UNC infiltration/exfiltration guard bypassed via NTFS junction; check runs on un-resolved path only (#1786)

* fix(cli): ImportServiceCommand.cs - repoImporter return value discarded; CLI import reports success even when UpsertAsync persists 0 rows (#1794)
* fix(cli): ImportServiceCommand.cs - Reparse-point guard only inspects immediate parent directory; intermediate ancestor junctions bypass the check (#1795)
* fix(cli): Import/ExportServiceCommand - duplicate ConfigFileType parsing logic (TryParseFileType vs inline parse) (#1800)
* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.cs - typeLabel uses culture-dependent ToUpper() instead of ToUpperInvariant() (#1801)

* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.cs - SaveFile's outer catch re-wraps the deliberate UNC SecurityException, hiding the specific reason (#1887)
* fix(cli): ImportServiceCommand.cs - reserved-device-name guard only checks the FIRST filename segment; siblings (e.g. service.CON.json) slip through (#1939)

* fix(cli): UninstallServiceCommand.cs - repository DeleteAsync drops CancellationToken after SCM uninstall succeeds (#2077)
* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.SaveFile - protected-folder check evaluates input path, not resolved path; symlink can redirect write into a system directory (#2113)
* fix(cli): Program.cs Main - finally-block disposal cascade is not exception-safe (same pattern as #2109) (#2136)
* fix(cli): Program.cs Run - embedded ServyServiceCLI.exe copy failure only prints to Console; CLI continues with degraded/missing service binary while Servy.UI throws on the same failure (#2149)

* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.SaveFile - SecurityException catch does not delete the stub file created by FileStream.OpenOrCreate, leaving 0-byte artifacts on disk (#2167)
* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.SaveFile - handle-resolution validation block is silently skipped when GetFinalPathNameByHandle returns 0, bypassing UNC and protected-folder re-checks (#2195)
* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.SaveFile - generic catch reports ordinary write failures (disk full, sharing violation, ACL denial) as 'Security Guard Failure: Target file handle validation rejected' (#2237)
* fix(cli): service-control commands - Start/Stop/Restart/Uninstall share a near-identical Execute skeleton (#2532)
* fix(psm1): Servy.psm1 - Format-SecureLogMessage hardcodes sensitive field list, decoupled from CLI options (#722)
* fix(psm1): misleading 'CLI moved or deleted' message also fires when CLI was never present at module load (#1496)

* fix(psm1): Invoke-ServyCli timeout calls Process.Kill() which orphans CLI child processes (#1977)
* fix(psm1): --envVars and --params values are exposed on the CLI process command line, defeating the log-scrubbing in Format-SecureLogMessage (#1986)
* fix(psm1): Format-SecureLogMessage unquoted-value pattern only masks first whitespace-delimited token, leaving multi-word values exposed (#1992)
* fix(psm1): Install-ServyService docstring EXAMPLE uses the deprecated -EnableRotation switch that the same module warns about at runtime (#2005)

* ci(test): test.yml - $args shadowed in test loop; PowerShell automatic variable should not be reassigned (#1699)
* ci(test): 'dotnet tool install dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool --version 5.*' uses a floating major version, breaking build reproducibility (#1940)
* ci(security): security.yml - Third-party actions pinned to mutable tags, supply chain risk in the security-audit workflow itself (same as #607, #1304) (#1309)
* ci(sonar): sonar.yml SONAR_TOKEN secret interpolated directly into shell command instead of using env var (#1673)
* ci(publish): publish.yml - Third-party actions pinned to mutable tags, supply chain risk (#607)
* ci(publish): version extraction reads stale parameter default from publish.ps1, always yields empty string (#1690)
* ci(publish): publish.yml - section comment says 'Extract Version from setup/publish.ps1' but the step reads setup/build-config.ps1 (#2559)
* ci(bump-version): minor-version rollover at 9 prevents 10+ minor versions; never publishes 8.10, 9.11, etc. (#1648)
* ci(bump-version): leftover commented-out tag-resolution block in 'Set version vars' step (#1669)
* ci(bump-version): unchecked 'git push' calls on main and net48 branches; same failure mode as #1729 and #1869 (#1881)
* ci(bump-version): ./bump-version.ps1 invoked without Invoke-Git/exit-code check; script failure is silently treated as 'no changes to commit' (#2203)
* ci(winget): winget.yml - winget-releaser action pinned by SHA with no version comment, unlike every other pinned action in the repo (#2529)
* ci(choco,scoop,bump-version): choco.yml, scoop.yml & bump-version.yml - identical 'Set version vars' tag-resolution block repeated in three workflows (#2527)
* ci(choco): chocolateyuninstall.ps1 - Test-Path fails on UninstallString with quoted path or embedded args, silently skips uninstall (#1691)
* ci(choco): choco.yml - choco pack / choco push native exit codes are not checked; a failed pack still triggers a push that can upload a stale nupkg or report green on a broken package (#1812)
* ci(choco): chocolateyuninstall.ps1 - $extraArgs is parsed from the registry UninstallString but then silently discarded; any registered uninstall flags are ignored (#2197)
* ci(choco): choco.yml - retry loop never aborts a paused rebase; one git pull conflict deadlocks all 5 attempts (#2216)
* ci(choco): choco.yml - 'nothing to commit' check uses '$(git status --porcelain) -eq $null', deviating from the '-ne '''' idiom in scoop.yml/bump-version.yml (#2561)
* ci(scoop): scoop.yml - Extras PR step uses 'git push --force' instead of '--force-with-lease', risking overwrite of concurrent updates (#1693)
* ci(scoop): scoop.yml - 'if (git show-ref --verify --quiet ...)' always evaluates to false in PowerShell (#1683)
* ci(scoop): scoop.yml - Write-ScoopManifest doubles every leading-space block, producing 8-space JSON indentation under pwsh 7 (#1697)
* ci(scoop): multiple unchecked 'git pull' and 'git push' calls in the manifest-update job; same failure mode as #1729 in a different file (#1869)
* ci(sonar): 'dotnet build' failure is masked by the trailing 'dotnet-sonarscanner end' step exit code; Sonar workflow reports green on broken builds (#1771)
* ci(sonar): 'dotnet tool install dotnet-sonarscanner' has no version pin, compromising build reproducibility (#1941)
* ci(sonar): sonar.yml - SonarCloud scanner cache key omits SONAR_SCANNER_VERSION, so bumping the version constant has no effect after the first cache hit (#2202)
* ci(security): vulnerable-package detection uses fragile English string match on dotnet list output; non-en locale or SDK rewording silently passes (#1913)
* ci(sbom): sbom.yml - adds entire $env:USERPROFILE to PATH and skips integrity pinning for dotnet-CycloneDX tool (#1728)
* ci(sbom): sbom.yml - 'dotnet tool install --add-source' does not restrict the install to the SHA256-verified local nupkg; nuget.org can still satisfy the request (#1912)
* ci(sbom): sbom.yml - '--ignore-failed-sources' on CycloneDX tool install silently bypasses the SHA-256 pinning when the local source fails (#2217)
* ci(sbom): sbom.yml - SHA256 pinning only covers the CycloneDX top-level .nupkg; transitive dependencies are fetched unverified from NuGet.org (#2226)
* ci(release): release.yml - workflow list ['winget','choco','scoop','bump-version','changelog'] hard-coded twice (trigger + script) (#1647)
* ci(loc): loc.yml - peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 pinned to mutable tag, supply chain risk (same family as #607, #1304, #1309) (#1342)
* ci(loc): loc.yml - GHA-LoC-Badge action pinned by SHA with no version comment, unlike other pinned actions (#2558)
* ci(changelog): git pull --rebase failure is not checked; git push runs regardless and can fail or push stale data (#1729)
* ci(changelog): 'gh api releases' failure (rate limit / 5xx) is unchecked; workflow reports 'No releases found' and exits 0, silently skipping the changelog update (#1868)
* ci(changelog): changelog.yml - Duplicate dead-code empty-releases check; second if block is unreachable (#2206)
* chore(deps): update dependencies
* other fixes: check commits for more details

  <summary>Click to expand release notes!</summary>

* feat(core): recovery for when the service process exits cleanly (#1311)
* fix(core): Timing/retry magic numbers scattered across LogTailer, ServiceHelper, DapperExecutor, ProcessHelper, RotatingStreamWriter - consolidate into AppConfig (#818)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.KillProcessTree - GetParentProcessId called O(N×depth) times during recursion (#826)
* fix(core): Helper.IsRunningInUnitTest - only detects xUnit; NUnit/MSTest assemblies fall through to production code paths (#830)
* fix(core): ServiceManager constructor - missing ArgumentNullException guards (inconsistent with rest of codebase) (#839)
* fix(core): Logger.cs - Log timestamp lacks UTC/local indicator, ambiguous when UseLocalTimeForRotation is enabled (#842)
* fix(core): DefaultRotationSize is duplicated between AppConfig and Logger (DRY) (#845)
* fix(core): DapperExecutor.cs - unreachable 'return default' after for-loops with const retry counts (#850)
* fix(core): NativeMethods.cs - duplicate Win32 status struct (ServiceStatus and SERVICE_STATUS) - name also collides with the public ServiceStatus enum (#865)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.cs - Win32 access-right and service-type constants are re-declared shadowing the same names in NativeMethods.cs (#867)
* fix(core): IServiceManager - async lifecycle methods (Start/Stop/Restart/Install) lack CancellationToken while Uninstall and read methods accept one (#871)
* fix(core): Helper.EscapeArgs and ProcessHelper.EscapeProcessArgument implement the same Win32 algorithm in two different files (#872)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.ResolvePath - XML doc and inline comment claim 'SERVICE’s environment' but the call expands the CALLER's environment (#878)
* fix(core): ServiceMapper.ToDomain - RecoveryAction default hardcoded as 'RecoveryAction.RestartService' instead of using 'AppConfig.DefaultRecoveryAction' (#892)
* fix(core): Service.cs (Domain) - RecoveryAction property has no default initializer; falls back to enum 0 (None) instead of AppConfig.DefaultRecoveryAction (RestartService) (#893)
* fix(core): Two parallel ServiceDto validators with different rule sets - XML/JSON imports skip upper-bound checks that CLI install enforces (#898)
* fix(core): EnvironmentVariablesValidator and EnvironmentVariableParser - duplicated 'SplitByUnescapedDelimiters' and 'IndexOfUnescapedChar' implementations (DRY) (#901)
* fix(core): ServiceDependenciesValidator - XML doc, inline comment, and error message all say 'letters/digits/hyphens/underscores' but the regex also allows '.' (#902)
* fix(core): Servy.Core Helper.GetBuiltWithFramework - naive 'net' prefix strip mangles 'netstandard*' TFMs into '.NET standard*' (#917)

* fix(core): AppFoldersHelper.EnsureFolders - hand-rolled connection-string parser fails on quoted paths and paths containing semicolons (#922)
* fix(core): Logger.Initialize - default parameter value '10' for logRotationSizeMB hardcoded instead of DefaultLogRotationSizeMB constant (#923)
* fix(core): ServiceDtoHelper.ApplyDefaults silently clobbers RunAsLocalSystem/UserAccount/Password - XML/JSON imports always force LocalSystem (#930)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.MaintainCache - races with GetLockForPid users; cleanup can hand out a NEW lock object for the same PID, defeating per-PID serialization (#934)
* fix(core): ServiceHelper.GetRunningServices - naive ImagePath parser splits on first space when no quotes, mangles legacy unquoted paths under 'Program Files' (#937)
* fix(core): AppConfig - DefaultStopTimeout (5s) and DefaultServiceStopTimeoutSeconds (60s) are two parallel 'stop timeout' defaults with no documented relationship; produces 12x asymmetry between Manager and Service (#942)
* fix(core): ServiceValidationRules.Validate - service-name / display-name / description length checks emit Warnings (non-blocking) for hard SCM limits, allowing invalid configs to pass validation (#943)
* fix(core): ServiceValidationRules.Validate - calls Helper.CreateParentDirectory side-effect for stdout/stderr paths during what should be a read-only validation (#944)
* fix(core): AppConfig - MaxConfigFileSizeMB (10MB) and MaxImportPayloadSizeChars (~2MB) reject the same import inconsistently (#960)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.InstallServiceAsync - EnablePreShutdown only refreshes timeout on initial create, not on existing-service update (#962)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.InstallServiceAsync - gMSA detection via EndsWith("$") misclassifies regular accounts whose name happens to end in $ (#966)
* fix(core): EventLogService.SearchAsync - sourceName constructor parameter is silently overridden by hardcoded AppConfig.EventSource filter at result-time (#969)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.CreateScoped - every scoped logger allocates a fresh EventLog handle (resource leak across scopes) (#973)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.UninstallServiceAsync - ChangeServiceConfig called on a handle opened without SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG (silent ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED) (#985)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.GetAllServices - trackedTasks ConcurrentBag is declared and joined but never populated (dead safety gate) (#986)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.KillProcessTreeAndParents(string) - root process name is not checked against CriticalSystemProcesses safelist (#990)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.GetMachineEntropy - uses Registry.LocalMachine which silently falls back to MachineName entropy when run as 32-bit (WoW64 redirection) (#993)
* fix(core): HandleHelper.GetProcessesUsingFile - synchronous StandardOutput.ReadToEnd defeats HandleExeTimeoutMs (handle.exe hang would block forever) (#996)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.TerminateBlockingProcesses - extension and targetFileName parameters are unused (kept for 'signature compatibility') (#999)
* fix(core): ServiceExporter.ExportJson and JsonServiceSerializer.Serialize use different JsonSerializerSettings - asymmetric JSON output (#1000)
* fix(core): SecureData.Dispose - _disposed flag set after ZeroMemory; concurrent Dispose calls can race through the guard (#1004)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.GetProcessTreeMetrics - comment claims sum can exceed 100% but the per-process formula is normalized to whole-machine capacity (#1005)
* fix(core): NativeMethods.AtomicSecureMove - name promises atomicity but MoveFileEx falls back to copy+delete across volumes (#1014)
* fix(core): NativeMethods.GetFileIdentity - two empty catch blocks with stale 'Fallback or log failure here if necessary' TODO comments (#1015)
* fix(core): NativeMethods.ValidateCredentials - silently passes for non-gMSA accounts when password is null/empty (function name promises validation) (#1016)
* fix(core): EnvironmentVariableParser.Parse - surrounding quotes are unconditionally stripped, no way to set an env var whose literal value starts and ends with double quotes (#1074)
* fix(core): AppConfig - TFM 'net10.0-windows' hardcoded into three path constants (silently stale on TFM upgrade) (#1027)
* fix(core): AppConfig - three near-identical Get*ServicePath / GetHandleExePath methods (DRY) (#1028)
* fix(core): EventIds.ScriptInfo (1100) and EventIds.ScriptWarning (2100) constants are defined but never referenced anywhere in the codebase (#1039)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.UninstallServiceAsync - bypasses _win32ErrorProvider with direct Marshal.GetLastWin32Error() in 2 places (test-seam violation) (#1041)
* fix(core): ServiceManager - MapStartupType returns Manual for ServiceStartMode.Boot/System but GetServiceStartupType returns null (silent data drift in batch list) (#1042)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller - Process.GetCurrentProcess() handle leaked in 2 places (lines 216, 286), inconsistent with line 78 (#1045)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.ResolvePath - Regex.Match called inline (uncompiled) on every path validation (#1046)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper - ResourceStalenessThresholdMinutes (20 min) hardcoded as private const, should live in AppConfig (#1047)
* fix(core): Servy.Core ServiceMapper.ToDto is dead code in src/ (only tests call it) (#1049)
* fix(core): Logger.cs hardcodes 'logs' subdirectory in 3 places (lines 91, 120, 349) (#1051)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.KillProcessTreeAndParents - calls Toolhelp32 snapshot twice per invocation (BuildProcessSnapshotNative + BuildParentChildMapNative) (#1059)
* fix(core): Helper.WriteFileAtomic and Helper.WriteFileAtomicAsync are ~95% duplicated (DRY) (#1060)
* fix(core): RotatingStreamWriter - Thread.Sleep called while holding _lock blocks all writers for up to 100ms during rotation retries (#1066)
* fix(core): RotatingStreamWriter._rotationDisabled is one-way: a single non-IO exception silently disables rotation forever, file grows unbounded (#1067)
* fix(core): RotatingStreamWriter.EnforceMaxRotations regex misses double-collision filenames produced by GenerateUniqueFileName, those rotated logs accumulate forever (#1068)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.GetKey/GetIV - no in-memory caching, full DPAPI roundtrip + 3-retry file read on every call #1069
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider - [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] on entire security class hides DPAPI/ACL regressions from coverage tooling (#1070)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider - three bare catch blocks (lines 256, 274, 310) swallow exceptions without binding the variable (#1071)
* fix(core): SecureData.Decrypt - tampered/truncated v2 payloads silently return the original ciphertext as 'plaintext', callers can't distinguish success from integrity failure (#1072)
* fix(core): SecureData.Decrypt - v1 marker path always accepts unauthenticated ciphertext, enabling silent v2->v1 downgrade by any writer of stored credentials (#1073)
* fix(core): HandleHelper.GetProcessesUsingFile - StringBuilder accessed unsynchronized after Kill on timeout, race with still-firing OutputDataReceived/ErrorDataReceived handlers (#1075)
* fix(core): ServiceMapper.ToDto omits Pid, ActiveStdoutPath, ActiveStderrPath; Domain->DTO->Domain round-trip silently drops runtime state (#1076)
* fix(core): Logger.Log - exception logged via $"{message}\nException: {ex}" then newline-sanitized to literal \r\n, stack traces become unreadable single-line escaped blobs (#1077)
* fix(core): ServiceValidationRules - service name only checks for '/' and '\', misses other SCM-rejected inputs (leading/trailing whitespace, control chars, '"', '|', etc.) (#1078)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.GetEmbeddedResourceLastWriteTimeUTC name and XML doc claim 'embedded resource' time, actually returns the exe's own File.GetLastWriteTimeUtc (#1079)
* fix(core): LogonAsServiceGrant.cs - [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] on entire LSA-privilege class hides regressions in security-sensitive code (#1092)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.cs - three SCM-tuning consts hardcoded (ServiceStartTimeoutSeconds, ScmPollIntervalMs, MaxParallelScmQueries) and inconsistent 250ms poll in Start/Stop (#1095)
* fix(core): ServiceExporter.cs - private nested Utf8StringWriter duplicates the public Servy.Core.IO.Utf8StringWriter class (#1104)
* fix(core): EscapedTokenizer - three methods duplicate the 'count preceding backslashes' loop (DRY) (#1105)
* fix(core): EnvironmentVariablesValidator.Validate - XML doc says 'exactly one unescaped equals' but code only requires >=1, and CountUnescapedChar pass is redundant before IndexOfUnescapedChar (#1113)
* fix(core): EscapedTokenizer.Unescape - escaped newline/semicolon split asymmetry: split treats \\r and \\n as escaped delimiters but Unescape never strips the backslash, leaving a stray '\' in the value (#1114)
* fix(core): OperationResult.Failure - XML doc claims ArgumentException is thrown only on null, but code throws on whitespace too (#1115)
* fix(core): RotatingStreamWriter.ShouldRotateByDate Weekly mode misses year-on-year rotation when both samples land in 'week 1' under ISO calendar year mismatch (#1116)
* fix(core): Logger.Log error fallback writes to logs/LoggerWriteErrors.log without first ensuring the directory exists, unlike InternalInitialize which calls SecurityHelper.CreateSecureDirectory (#1117)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.SetIsEventLogEnabled - when InitializeEventLog fails, _isEventLogEnabled is overwritten back to the requested 'true' state, leaving _eventLog null but flag pretending logging is on (#1118)
* fix(core): EventLogReader.ReadEvents - cutoff EventRecord at maxReadCount yields break before using-block, leaking the just-fetched native handle (#1119)
* fix(core): ServiceControllerWrapper.BuildDependencyTree - currentPath retains stale entries when an exception is thrown after Add but before RemoveAt, corrupting cycle detection for siblings (#1120)
* fix(core): JsonServiceSerializer.Deserialize logs first 100 chars of malformed JSON to error log on JsonException - can leak Password if it appears early in the payload (#1121)
* fix(core): XmlServiceSerializer.Deserialize/Serialize allocate XmlSerializer per call instead of caching it statically (parallel impl of #1121 + perf hit) (#1122)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.GetAllServices - LogOnAs initialized to magic string "LocalSystem" instead of LocalSystemAccount const defined in same file (#1131)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.UninstallServiceAsync - stop wait loop uses DefaultServiceStopTimeoutSeconds instead of per-service StopTimeout (asymmetric with StopServiceAsync) (#1132)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.GetDependencies - null return is overloaded (means both "service not installed" and "unexpected error") (#1133)
* fix(core): SecurityHelper.CreateSecureDirectory - silently swallows UnauthorizedAccessException without logging, leaves no audit trail when ACL hardening fails (#1137)
* fix(core): XmlServiceValidator/JsonServiceValidator - both treat ValidationResult.Warnings as blocking failures, defeating the purpose of separate Errors/Warnings collections (#1139)
* fix(core): WindowsServiceApi - [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] on the entire class hides regressions in the non-trivial GetServices() loop (parallel to #1070 and #1092) (#1138)
* fix(core): EventIds.cs declares only base ranges (1000/2000/3000) but specific IDs (3001/3002/3003/3103/3104) are hardcoded magic numbers in ProtectedKeyProvider.cs and the taskschd scripts (#1144)
* fix(core): Servy.Core DTOs/ServiceInfo.cs constructor - LogOnAs hardcoded to 'LocalSystem' magic string instead of ServiceAccounts.LocalSystem const (parallel to #1131) (#1160)
* fix(core): Servy.Core Native/Handle.cs - process-handle wrapper class is named 'Handle' while the three siblings (SafeScmHandle / SafeServiceHandle / SafeJobObjectHandle) all follow the SafeXxxHandle BCL convention (#1161)
* fix(core): EventLogReader.MapToDto - 'evt.TimeCreated ?? DateTime.MinValue' converts implicitly to DateTimeOffset and throws ArgumentOutOfRangeException in non-UTC time zones when TimeCreated is null (#1167)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.cs - [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] on entire class hides regressions in non-trivial logic (BFS process-tree walker, CPU-delta cache pruning, RAM formatter, ResolvePath regex flow); parallel to #1070 / #1092 / #1138 (#1169)
* fix(core): EventLogService.cs - MaxResults (10000) and LogName ('Application') hardcoded as private consts; LogName is also duplicated in EventLogLogger and Helper.EnsureEventSourceExists (#1170)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.CopyEmbeddedResource - outer catch misattributes restart failures (StartServices in finally) as 'Failed to copy embedded resource' when the copy itself succeeded (#1171)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.cs - Nullable IServiceRepository? parameter contradicts ArgumentNullException guard (#1176)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.GetAllServices - ServiceController handles leak on cancellation (#1183)
* fix(core): Servy.Core.Helpers.ServiceHelper constructor silently accepts null repository, NREs at runtime (#1187)

* fix(core): AppConfig.cs - MaxMaxFailedChecks / MaxMaxRestartAttempts / MaxPreLaunchRetryAttempts set to int.MaxValue, inconsistent with other Max* constants and creates overflow risk in counters (#1193)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.cs - SafeWriteToEventLog reads _eventLog without volatile/lock; SetIsEventLogEnabled can null it concurrently (#1205)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.cs - EventLogMessageMaxChars (31000) hardcoded; should live in AppConfig with the other Event-Log constants (#1206)
* fix(core): Logging-&-Log-Rotation.md - Event ID 3002 is documented in the 'Error' range table but the entry itself describes a Warning, contradicting the actual EventLogEntryType.Warning emitted by the code (#1210)
* fix(core): EnvironmentVariableHelper.cs - ProtectedVariables list omits DOTNET_ROOT, DOTNET_HOST_PATH, DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR - .NET runtime hijacking via env var override (#1212)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.cs - GetCachedOrGenerate fast-path reads cacheField without synchronization; race with InvalidateCache can NRE on Clone() (#1213)
* fix(core): SecureData.cs - IDisposable class holding raw AES/HMAC keys has no finalizer; forgotten Dispose leaves key material unwiped until GC (#1214)
* fix(core): JsonServiceValidator.cs - Copy-paste bug: warning log says 'XML Import succeeded with warnings' inside the JSON validator (#1215)
* fix(core): Logger.cs / RotatingStreamWriter.cs - Date format strings use thread-default culture; produce non-Gregorian years on Thai locale (Buddhist calendar) (#1216)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.cs - IDisposable holding decrypted AES key/IV has no finalizer; forgotten Dispose leaves plaintext key material in managed heap until GC (#1220)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.cs - WaitForExit timeout floor only applied to KillParentWaitMs (Math.Max 1000); KillChildWaitMs/KillTreeWaitMs honor smaller values without floor (#1222)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.cs - KillProcessTreeAndParents(int) lacks the top-level try/catch present on the string overload, leaks exceptions to callers (#1223)
* fix(core): EventLogService.cs - EventLogMaxResults caps raw events before filtering; '[' bracket heuristic and provider-name substring filter silently drop matches, so user sees fewer hits than configured (#1228)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.cs - KillParentProcesses recursive call passes DateTime.MinValue, disabling PID-recycling identity check for grandparents and beyond (#1231)
* fix(core): Logger.cs - _currentLogLevel read on hot logging path without volatile or lock; updates may go unobserved (#1236)
* fix(core): ServiceHelper.cs (Core) - StopServices ignores PreStopTimeoutSeconds, stop wait too short when pre-stop hook configured (#1241)
* fix(core): ServiceHelper.cs (Core) - StartServices ignores PreLaunchTimeoutSeconds, start wait too short when pre-launch hook configured (#1242)
* fix(core): ServiceHelper.cs - Hardcoded 'defaultTimeoutInSeconds = 30' should reference AppConfig.DefaultServiceStartTimeoutSeconds (#1243)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.cs - UninstallServiceAsync GetByNameAsync call drops cancellationToken (#1244)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.cs - WalkAndKillChildren recursive walk has no cycle/visited-set protection (DFS)  (#1247)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.cs - GetHostProcessLastWriteTimeUTC fallback to UtcNow forces unconditional re-extraction every startup (#1248)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.cs - Constructor instantiates concrete ServiceHelper instead of accepting an abstraction; tightly couples and blocks unit testing (#1249)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.cs - ValidatePath swallows InvalidOperationException, losing diagnostic context for unexpanded environment variables (#1250)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.cs - 'targetFileName' out parameter on ShouldCopyResource is set but never consumed by either caller (#1256)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.cs - CopyEmbeddedResource (async) and CopyEmbeddedResourceSync are asymmetric: async stops/restarts services, sync silently doesn't (#1257)
* fix(core): Helper.cs - WriteFileAtomic (sync) calls async core via .GetAwaiter().GetResult(); deadlock risk on captured SynchronizationContext (#1259)
* fix(core): Logger.cs - FormatException recurses on InnerException with no depth limit; pathological chains can blow the stack (#1260)
* fix(core): AppConfig.cs - DefaultDesktopAppPublishPath / DefaultManagerAppPublishPath use './X.exe' which is CWD-dependent, not BaseDirectory-anchored (#1266)
* fix(core): AppConfig.cs - Five-level '..\..\..\..\..' relative paths to sibling project bin folders are fragile and break under publish/single-file/custom output (#1268)
* fix(core): ServiceExporter.cs - ExportXml string vs file overloads diverge in null handling and UTF-8 BOM behavior (#1269)
* fix(core): Helper.cs - IsServiceNameValid does not enforce the Windows SCM 256-character maximum service name length (#1279)

* fix(core): XmlServiceValidator.cs / JsonServiceValidator.cs - Redundant ValidatePath call after _serviceValidationRules.Validate (#1285)
* fix(core): NativeMethods.cs - ValidateCredentials .\AccountName forms throw SecurityException because Translate runs before built-in bypass (#1286)
* fix(core): NativeMethods.cs - FILE_IDENTITY.IsDifferentFrom does asymmetric comparison when handle-info presence differs between the two probes (#1287)
* fix(core): ServiceDto.cs - Clone() omits EnableConsoleUI; cloned DTOs silently lose console-UI flag (#1290)

* fix(publish): publish-common.ps1 - New-PortablePackage comment 'compress contents of the folder, not the folder itself' contradicts the actual 7-Zip invocation which includes the folder itself (#1226)
* ci(setup-dotnet): .github/actions/setup-dotnet/action.yml - 'version' input + DOTNET_VERSION env are dead; install version actually comes from global.json (#1261)
* ci(publish): publish.yml - Copy-Item -Recurse -Exclude does not match files in subdirectories (same bug as #1200, different file; also packages portable 7z) (#1303)
* ci(choco): chocolateyuninstall.ps1 - 'Servy*' wildcard lookup mis-handles multi-match case (silent partial uninstall) (#1340)
* ci(security): 'Scan for vulnerable packages' uses legacy 'powershell' shell instead of 'pwsh' (parallels #1082) (#1097)
* ci(security): Concurrency block commented out (lines 26-28); either delete or activate (#1098)
* ci(release): 'changelog' workflow triggers this run but is missing from the validation list (asymmetry) (#1099)
* ci(dotnet-reflection): comment claims 'disabled' but workflow_dispatch is still active; also typo 'worflow' and commented-out triggers (#1100)
* ci(sbom): sbom.yml - Generate SBOM step skips exit-code checks between five dotnet-CycloneDX invocations; partial-failure completes with success status (#1312)
* ci(sonar): sonar.yml - Missing top-level permissions block leaves GITHUB_TOKEN at repo defaults; PR trigger silently commented out (#1310)
* ci(loc): loc.yml - 'Create total LoC badge' step uses 'curl -s' without -f or exit-code check; shields.io HTTP errors are silently published as the LoC total badge (#1313)
* ci: five workflow files saved as Windows-1252 (Non-ISO extended-ASCII) instead of UTF-8, breaking YAML 1.2 spec and rendering em-dashes as mojibake (#954)
* chore(deps): update dependencies

* fix(service): Console.CursorVisible causes service crash when running console app as Windows service (#814)
* fix(core): ImportServiceCommandTests - MockXmlValidator/MockJsonValidator ignore isValid parameter (#738)
* fix(core): implement fine-grained per-PID locking and atomic cache pruning in ProcessHelper (#796)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.UninstallServiceAsync - stop-wait loop ignores cancellation, blocks up to ServiceStopTimeoutSeconds (#798)
* fix(core): HandleHelper.cs - regex timeout hardcoded to 1s, bypasses AppConfig.InputRegexTimeout convention (#801)
* fix(core): ServiceValidationRules.cs - Service name not validated against SCM-forbidden characters (\, /) (#806)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.cs - ServiceStopTimeoutSeconds hardcoded as a local const, should live in AppConfig (#809)
* fix(core): ServiceDto.cs - ShouldSerializEnableSizeRotation typo (missing 'e') breaks conditional serialization of EnableSizeRotation (#810)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.GetAllServices - Parallel.ForEach has no per-service timeout, single hung SCM RPC blocks a worker (#819)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.CriticalSystemProcesses - incomplete safelist; killing dwm/MsMpEng/audiodg/fontdrvhost can destabilize the host (#825)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.GetProcessTreeMetrics - caps summed CPU at 100%, hides multi-core saturation (#829)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.EscapeArgument - fails to double backslashes that precede an internal quote (Win32 CommandLineToArgvW corruption) (#827)
* fix(core): Logger.cs - MaxBackupFiles is hardcoded to 0 (unlimited), no admin override path (#838)
* fix(core): SecureData.Decrypt - on crypto failure of marked payload, returns the post-marker payload (not the documented 'original cipherText') (#848)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.GetOrGenerate - comment claims 'exponential backoff' but Thread.Sleep math is linear (#852)
* fix(core): ProcessHelper.cs - EscapeProcessArgument is dead code; only the broken EscapeArgument is called (#857)
* fix(core): ProtectedKeyProvider.SaveProtected - WindowsIdentity from GetCurrent() is never disposed (handle leak per save) (#861)
* fix(core): SecurityHelper.CreateSecureDirectory - WindowsIdentity from GetCurrent() never disposed (handle leak per call) (#868)
* fix(core): LogonAsServiceGrant.Ensure - InvalidOperationException loses the underlying SID-resolution failure cause (#874)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper + ServiceExporter - non-atomic file writes can leave truncated/partial files on crash, mid-copy interruption, or disk full (#875)
* fix(core): SecurityHelper.ApplySecurityRules - comparing the current user's SID to BuiltinAdministrators/LocalSystem GROUP SIDs is meaningless (#933)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.KillProcessTreeAndParents(string) - silent catch-all swallows ALL errors with no logging (#935)
* fix(core): ProcessKiller.KillProcessTree - uses stale 'allProcesses' snapshot during recursion; processes spawned mid-walk survive (#936)
* fix(core): ResourceHelper.TerminateBlockingProcesses - for .exe resources, kills ALL processes matching the filename, including unrelated instances belonging to other services (#938)
* fix(core): Logger.Log - bare 'catch { /* Fail-silent */ }' on the write path swallows every I/O exception with no fallback channel (#940)
* fix(core): ServiceManager.GetAllServices - orphaned PopulateNativeDetails task races with results consumer and uses scmHandle after dispose (#965)
* fix(core): EventLogReader.ReadEvents - materializes the entire result set in memory before MaxResults limit can apply (#970)
* fix(core): EventLogLogger.Info/Warn/Error - EventLog.WriteEntry calls have no try/catch and no length truncation (32766-char limit) (#971)
* fix(core): ServiceControllerWrapper.BuildDependencyTree - bare catch swallows every error with no logging, leaving '(Unavailable)' nodes indistinguishable (#972)
* fix(infra): ServiceRepository.cs - XmlSerializer instantiated per export, leaks dynamic assemblies (#816)
* fix(infra): ServiceRepository.UpsertBatchAsync - IN clause uses default BINARY collation while upsert key is LOWER(Name); ID sync misses case-mismatched rows (#820)
* fix(infra): ServiceRepository.SearchAsync - Name LIKE `@Pattern` is case-sensitive for non-ASCII characters; rest of the repo uses LOWER(...) = LOWER(...) (#881)
* fix(service): ProcessWrapper.cs - CancelOutputRead/CancelErrorRead missing ThrowIfDisposed check (#800)
* fix(service): ServiceHelper.cs - duplicate using Servy.Core.Config directive (#802)
* fix(service): CheckHealth handler never -= from _healthCheckTimer before Dispose, delegate leak on each restart cycle (#803)
* fix(service): fileSemaphore and _healthCheckSemaphore never disposed, kernel handle leak on teardown (#807)
* fix(service): ProcessLauncher.ApplyLanguageFixes - substring match on 'python'/'java' in FileName produces false positives (#834)
* fix(service): ProcessWrapper.WaitUntilRunningAsync - always waits the full timeout, never returns 'running' early (#858)
* fix(service): ProcessLauncher.Start - TimeoutMs silently ignored when OnScmHeartbeat is null (#860)
* fix(service): truncated XML doc tag '/// \<pa' on the unit-test constructor (#889)
* fix(service): ServiceHelper - SensitiveKeyWords list and MaskingRegex pattern are out of sync (CREDENTIAL / CONNECTIONSTRING / CERTIFICATE missing from regex) (#896)
* fix(service): ServiceHelper.MaskSensitiveValue - substring-based keyword match flags non-secret env-var names (e.g. MONKEY, APIPATH, PRIVATELY) (#929)
* fix(service): ProcessLauncher.Start - synchronous launch with TimeoutMs == 0 falls into unbounded WaitForExit() and can hang the service (#952)
* fix(service): ProcessExtensions.GetChildren / GetAllDescendants - bare catch swallows ALL errors with no logging (parallel to #935) (#975)
* fix(service): ProcessLaunchOptions.TimeoutMs - XML doc says 0 = infinite wait but ProcessLauncher.Start throws ArgumentException when TimeoutMs \<= 0 (#976)
* fix(desktop): add None date rotation type (#812)
* fix(desktop,manager): all ViewModels coupled to Application.Current - cannot instantiate in tests (#429)
* fix(desktop,manager): ViewModels directly use Mouse.OverrideCursor - fails without WPF context (#431)
* fix(desktop,manager): FileSystemWatcher event handlers never unsubscribed before Dispose (#804)
* fix(desktop,manager): AsyncCommand.Execute - async void with no try/catch propagates exceptions to the WPF dispatcher and can crash the UI (#866)
* fix(desktop,manager): MainWindow.OnClosed (Servy + Manager) - Process.GetCurrentProcess() handle never disposed (#873)
* fix(manager): ServiceCommands.cs - SearchServicesAsync does not filter nulls returned by ToModelAsync (#797)
* fix(manager): ProcessHelper calls made without _metricsLock held, inconsistent with MainViewModel (#799)
* fix(manager): ConsoleViewModel / PerformanceViewModel - StopMonitoring hides base virtual method instead of overriding it (#808)
* fix(manager): MonitoringViewModelBase.OnTick - async void handler does not wrap OnTickAsync in try/catch; an unhandled exception will crash the WPF dispatcher (#982)
* fix(cli): ExportServiceCommand.cs - new Uri(fullPath) throws UriFormatException on legitimate paths (#815)
* fix(cli,psm1): DateRotationType.None missing from documented enum values (#812)
* fix(cli):  ExportServiceCommand - ReservedPortRegex misses COM0/LPT0 (and Unicode-superscript COM¹/LPT¹/etc.) per current Microsoft naming docs (#900)
* fix(psm1): Servy.psd1 - AliasesToExport declared twice; line 85 empty array overwrites line 76 entries (#811)
* fix(psm1): Assert-Administrator - WindowsIdentity from GetCurrent() never disposed (handle leak per call) (#864)
* fix(psm1): Invoke-ServyCli - finally block calls process.WaitForExit() with no timeout; if Kill() failed, PowerShell hangs forever (#879)
* fix(psm1): Install-ServyService - dead 'if ($paramName -eq "Password") { continue }' guard (no '--password' entry exists in $paramMapping) (#891)
* fix(tests): ProcessHelper and ProcessKiller are static - cannot be mocked (#430)
* fix(tests): multiple test files - Mock-only tests verify Moq dispatch, not production code (#552)
* fix(tests): TestableService - 16 reflection hops into Service private members with silent null-forgiving (#742)
* fix(tests): test fixtures - 13 occurrences of maintainer-specific Python path (C:\Users\aelassas\...) (#753)
* fix(iss): NumericVersion drops patch component, mis-classifies upgrade vs reinstall (#817)
* fix(publish): 8 publish-res scripts are structurally identical (~800 lines) (#406)
* fix(publish): signpath.ps1 - API token stored in plaintext file with no ACL guidance (#583)
* fix(notifications): Get-ServyLastErrors.ps1 - Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable requires PS 3.0+, contradicts script's "PowerShell 2.0 or later" header (#805)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 --claims PowerShell 2.0 compatibility but dot-sources a script that #Requires -Version 3.0 (#836)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 / ServyFailureNotification.ps1 - masking regex lacks word boundaries, can mangle non-secret content (#837)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 / Get-ServyLastErrors.ps1 - DateTime.Parse on watermark/parameters is culture-sensitive while the file is written invariant ISO 8601 (#863)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 - SmtpClient is never disposed; comment about 'PS 2.0 / .NET 3.5' is incorrect (#884)
* fix(notifications): Get-ServyLastErrors.ps1 - fallback log file is named 'ServyFailureEmail.log' (copy-paste from sibling script) (#926)
* fix(notifications): ServyFailureEmail.ps1 and ServyFailureNotification.ps1 - concurrent watermark re-read uses bare [DateTime]::Parse instead of ParseExact, can silently misinterpret Kind under non-en-US culture (#945)
* fix(bump-runtime): TFM regex 'net\d+\.\d+' lacks word boundary, can match inside larger tokens (#844)
* ci(bump-version): ValidatePattern rejects 3-segment versions but help text claims they are supported (#843)
* ci(bump-version): silently 'succeeds' when regex pattern fails to match (no replacements) (#885)
* ci(scoop): gh CLI authenticates via GH_PAT but gh reads GH_TOKEN; merged-PR duplicate check is a silent no-op (#886)
* ci(choco): retry loop around 'git push' never retries because PowerShell try/catch does not catch non-zero exit from native commands (#887)
* chore(deps): updated dependencies
