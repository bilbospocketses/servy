.SYNOPSIS
    Publishes the Servy WPF application as a self-contained executable and signs it.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script performs the following steps:
      1. Runs the resource publishing script (publish-res-debug.ps1 or publish-res-release.ps1, selected by -BuildConfiguration).
      2. Builds and publishes `Servy.csproj` as a self-contained win-x64 executable
      3. Signs the published executable using SignPath (if enabled)

.PARAMETER Tfm
    Target Framework Moniker (default: "net10.0-windows").

.PARAMETER BuildConfiguration
    Build configuration to use (default: "Release").

.PARAMETER Runtime
    Target runtime identifier (RID) for publishing (default: "win-x64").

.NOTES
    Requirements:
      - .NET SDK must be installed
      - The SignPath script (signpath.ps1) must exist in ../../setup/

.EXAMPLE
    ./publish.ps1
    Publishes using default parameters.
