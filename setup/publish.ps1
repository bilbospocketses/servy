.SYNOPSIS
    Main build script for generating the Servy self-contained installer.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script orchestrates the build process for Servy by invoking the internal
    publish script:
        - publish-sc.ps1   (self-contained bundle)

.PARAMETER Tfm
    The target framework moniker (TFM).

.PARAMETER Version
    The Servy version being packaged.

.EXAMPLE
    PS> .\publish.ps1 -Tfm "net10.0-windows" -Version "8.5"

.NOTES
    This script can be run from any working directory. It calculates elapsed time
    and pauses at the end to allow double-click usage from Explorer.

    Requirements:
        1. MSBuild must be available in PATH.
        2. Inno Setup (ISCC.exe) installed and accessible.
        3. 7-Zip installed with `7z` available in PATH.
